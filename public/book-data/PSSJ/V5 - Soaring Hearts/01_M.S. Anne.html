<head><title>01_M.S. Anne</title></head><p>&quot;I can&#x27;t believe we still made it in time!&quot; Swole&#x27;s breaths come out evenly despite his morning jog to catch the luxury cruiser: The M.S. Anne.</p>
<p>Dawn on the other hand, is gasping down air after being forced to run for her life. &quot;<em>Huff.</em> We... We still have 15 minutes... Why the hell did you make me run so fast!?&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn Berlitz and Swole Solo have ended up in a short line of trainers. The captain of the M.S. Anne stands at the front of the line where he greets everyone one after another.</p>
<p>The ship itself is gigantic. 2 houses tall. Roughly 2 football fields long. With 5 rows of windows, which become larger on the higher stories.</p>
<p>The more you pay, the better your room becomes and the greater the view of the ocean is.</p>
<p>On all 5 stories combined, a total of up to 2000 people can live here comfortably and just the first story alone can hold around 500 people without issues.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not just about making it in time.&quot; Swole states. &quot;If Regirock had been any faster, we&#x27;d have been turned into toast. Or pancakes. What if we meet another dangerous pokemon that is too fast for you? You&#x27;re definitely going to continue training with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Once again, our hero has lost himself in worries.</p>
<p>But Dawn only gathered one thing from his little speech, &quot;Y-you&#x27;re worrying about me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I&#x27;m worrying. Stupid. What&#x27;s there not to worry about, with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ha ha, you prick!&quot; And as if to prove his point, she just barely touches his shoulder in what she would call a punch.</p>
<p>&quot;Buuut, alright. If you insist on training more with me, then I guess I will just need to accept it.&quot; A smile crosses over Dawn&#x27;s face as she thinks about what awaits her in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahem.&quot; </p>
<p>Dawn and Swole both startle as the captain tries to get their attention. Without noticing it they have become first in line and the old captain has his hand struck out. </p>
<p>He waits for Swole to return his greeting.</p>
<p>The two men share a firm handshake while Swole studies his peculiar face. &quot;Good morning.&quot;</p>
<p>The captain wears a leathery, old and wrinkly face with short, gray hair. He looks old enough to have retired long ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-- Ahem. Moin.&quot; The ancient captain&#x27;s voice is deep, gravely and slow with a North-East-Kalos accent.</p>
<p>Our heroes know enough of Kalos to recognize &#x27;moin&#x27; as their version of a greeting in some parts.</p>
<p>&quot;Moin, and velcome aboard the M.S. Anne, junge trainers. My name is Wilhelm von der Elle and I am the captain of this beautiful ship. Unfortunately ve do not have the necessary... uhm... Personal, to handle ze uhm... Körperflüssigkeiten of young couples. Please do sleep in zwei separate rooms. Rooms number 4006 and 4007.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, he expects them to have sex and the staff does not want to do the cleanup.</p>
<p>&quot;T-that-- that won&#x27;t be necessary.&quot; Dawn says as a massive blush spreads across her face.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s a company policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps then they can catch up on some sleep. After all, they did not get much the previous night.</p>
<p>The teenagers used to have sleepovers and even slept in the same bed before when they were children. But last night was the first time since hormones have set in for both of them.</p>
<p>Needless to say, neither were able to sleep well while their thoughts kept swirling into chaos.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way, captain, how long will it take before we make the next stop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ve vill arrive at Chocovine Town tomorrow morning.&quot; A quaint coastal town to the north of Jubilife City.</p>
<p>The plan for the M.S. Anne is to travel north, all around Sinnoh and drop off portions of refugees all over the region to distribute their economic impact better.</p>
<p>Just as the two trainers start approaching the stairs leading up to the ship, Wilhelm&#x27;s voice rings out once more. &quot;And just ein more thing. Ze passengers might riot at zome point. Ve vill ask all trainers to support us, should zat come to pass.&quot;</p>
<p>And after hearing that ominous warning they continue their walk on the boarding stairs.</p>
<p>Right at the entrance to the ship, there is an advertisement for all the luxurious activities that the M.S. Anne offers to their passengers. Customers in the 4th story have access to almost all of them.</p>
<p>Without a need to discuss it, both trainers are immediately on the same page and look for the stairs to get the luxury cruise started.</p>
<p>They walk with such a hurry that they do not notice what peers at them from behind the doors on the first story.</p>
<p>Families of refugees, 2 to 3 families per room, stare through small circular windows set into their doors in jealousy as they watch the trainers hurry past them in elation.</p>
<p>Some would call it the punishment for the parents who abandoned their region and the children are punished alongside them for their parents&#x27; actions.</p>
<p>But stuck inside their rooms, treated like cattle, they do not plan to think or reflect on their actions. With no understanding of the situation and with not enough guards to enforce the situation...</p>
<p>A powder keg is in the making.</p>
<p>Countless windows show the same scenes inside as they walk along the hallway to the main-stairs.</p>
<p>Depression is rampant. And a miasma of darkness spreads across the ship.</p>
<p>&quot;Dawn... my paranoid Spinarak-senses are tingling. We&#x27;re not splitting up on the ship, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Even Dawn feels the slight unease on the ship. &quot;... Alright.&quot; For the first time, she finds herself in agreement without even questioning his paranoia.</p>
<p>But a former favorite past-times of Barry, Lucas, Swole and Dawn, lets them continue their cruise without any real fear: &#x27;Who would win, 1000 humans versus Cynthia&#x27;s Garchomp&#x27; And Garchomp wins every time.</p>
<p>Swole understands that a single Incinerate by Salandit down a hallway would be enough to win any altercation with the refugees.</p>
<p>The Platinum family knows this as well and covers the costs for any trainer who wants to travel on the M.S. Anne.</p>
<p>They are the guards.</p>
<p>After walking up some stairs for a while and passively navigating around the ship, Dawn points out a door with the room number 4007.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s leave our stuff and start exploring!&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand meets the door knob, twists and the door opens.</p>
<p>An elaborate, vintage, cast-iron key sticks on the inside of the door, which Dawn immediately pulls out and pockets. &quot;My room.&quot;</p>
<p>The room is lavishly decorated: The floor is covered in a fluffy red carpet, holds a large, queen-sized, double bed with red velvet sheets and white silken pillows, a sturdy desk with a champagne bottle on top and proudly displays the main feature which is a balcony leading out towards the sea.</p>
<p>In the container of the champagne bottle is only a thin puddle of water instead of the usual ice cubes.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not so sure if we should drop off our stuff. There&#x27;s easily 2.000₽ in our bags.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief.&quot; Dawn says. &quot;Alright, you worry-wart. I&#x27;ll just carry my bag around... You know? You should be a little more optimistic. Like me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief... Your optimism is going to get your stuff stolen. Or worse, like abducted or killed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won&#x27;t need to worry about that with you around. Uhhh, but with that thought in mind, stay pessimistic. We are complementing each so well, aren&#x27;t we? Hehe?&quot;</p>
<p>Swole did not notice the attempted flirt and just rolls his eyes in response at her carelessness.</p>
<p>He quickly picks up the key of the identical room 4006, locks the door and then heads towards the deck with Dawn.</p>
<p>Everything in the 4th story is designed around the deck. Every room connects to a corridor and they lead straight to the deck. All the goods and services are available there.</p>
<p>However, currently, the deck is practically abandoned. </p>
<p>There is one other trainer who relaxes by the pool while he scratches his Granbull - a large, pink, doglike pokemon - behind the ears.</p>
<p>The only staff member around is a blonde woman by the bar. She is bored out of her mind and leans against her work surface with nothing to do while her violet eyes lazily scan over the deck.</p>
<p>A short tremor passes through the ship. Its engines started and motion sets in. A long blast of the ship&#x27;s horn signals the beginning of its journey.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think they are still doing massages?&quot; Dawn asks. &quot;I was really looking forward to one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I doubt it. But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to ask, right?&quot;</p>
<p>The woman perks up as a distraction approaches her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello! I&#x27;m bartending Beth! And-- My eyes are up here. And welcome to my bar! We&#x27;re serving any kinds of drinks for the trainers traveling with us - free of charge of course and no IDs needed. What can I get for you?&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn boxes Swole&#x27;s shoulder before answering for the pair. &quot;Hi, we don&#x27;t want any drinks. We wanted to ask if the massage parlor can be used?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, just ring one of these bells and a worker will come to help you.&quot; She points out a golden service bell that is placed next to the drink-taps.</p>
<p>With that explanation, the pair of trainers say their goodbyes and head over to the abandoned-looking massage parlor. They find the service bell and ring it.</p>
<p>For quite a while, nothing happens. And just as Swole and Dawn are about to give up and spend the day in their rooms instead, a staff member arrives.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi! Sorry for being late! My name is Maria the masseuse. Are you both interested in a massage session? Come lie down!&quot;</p>
<p>She wears a tight, white masseuse outfit, bound closed with a ribbon and a short pencil skirt. The woman has curly, luscious blonde hair, tied up in twin drills and her eyes are of violet color.</p>
<p>&quot;I will just need another moment to get my equipment ready. Would the both of you undress in the meantime and wait for me on the table?&quot;</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Would the both of you undress in the meantime and wait for me on the table?&quot; She leaves immediately without giving us a chance to respond.</p>
<p>My eyes drift to Dawn&#x27;s. A blush spreads on her face before she looks away.</p>
<p>Agreeing to this was a big mistake.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>I remove my Buneary-brown scarf but then my hands get the jitters when I pull off my plain white sweater.</p>
<p>Undressing in front of Dawn is so much worse than just being in my swimwear or underwear!</p>
<p>Dawn gets out of her pink Piloswine fleece coat but then her hands begin to shake as she pulls her black shirt over her head.</p>
<p>Her hat gets stuck and she accidentally pulls it off with it, revealing her very messy hair underneath.</p>
<p>&quot;... Stop staring. I didn&#x27;t have time to fix my hair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it. It looks kinda cute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No it doesn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes it does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nuh uh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now you&#x27;re just fishing for compliments.&quot;</p>
<p>Her pout just makes her cuter.</p>
<p>After joking a little, unbuckling my pants and getting out of them doesn&#x27;t feel quite as bad anymore.</p>
<p>Back at Dawn, she can be seen without her white under-shirt in only her bra and is now... unzipping her skirt?</p>
<p>Her skirt has a hidden zipper behind one of the folds of her skirt. Weird. Never thought about how they are fastened to a woman&#x27;s waist before. This info might come in handy one day.</p>
<p>Her underwear is pink today. With white frills. Very cute.</p>
<p>After tracing the outline of her body once again with my eyes, I notice that her own eyes are fixed firmly in place on my underwear. </p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing unusual to see there.</p>
<p>... I start to tense up my arms and abs for no particular reason.</p>
<p>I startle when I hear a voice. &quot;All of your clothes, please.&quot; The incredibly stealthy masseuse is back.</p>
<p>What was her name? Maria?</p>
<p>&quot;You can use these towels to cover yourselves up.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn takes one. &quot;Uhm... Swole, could you look away now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! Seriously? His name is Swole? That&#x27;s hilarious.&quot; <em>Massaging Maria</em> of all people says and puts herself on the shit-list with that comment.</p>
<p>Well, all the way on the bottom. It wasn&#x27;t a harsh burn and she is hot. Her boobs are especially hot.</p>
<p>And as much as I want to continue looking at them and at Dawn, I don&#x27;t want Dawn to feel too uncomfortable either. So I turn away from her for some privacy.</p>
<p>But as luck would have it there is a mirror positioned on the wall to give me a perfect view of what&#x27;s going on behind my back.</p>
<p>Dawn has her back turned to me and Maria helps her with the hooks of her bra.</p>
<p>Her bare back is pleasant to look at but my heart begins to race when she puts her thumbs under the waistband of her panties. The main-prize for my observant eyes.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s happening slowly. Agonizingly slowly. She pulls down her panties and bares her ass almost as if in slow-motion.</p>
<p>And then she pulls it lower, much lower and she has to bend over to pull it even lower and... What is that? </p>
<p>What is it my eyes have peered at? Is that her ... honey pot? I think I just caught a glimpse of it!</p>
<p>Sweet!</p>
<p>But then the show comes to an end when she stands back up and wraps the towel around her torso. All good things must come to an end after all...</p>
<p>I begin to pull down my own underwear but that&#x27;s when I notice my pokemon stare intently at me through the mirror. Each with a bag of popcorn in their paws and claws.</p>
<p>... Wait what?</p>
<p>No. Just my imagination. They are watching closely, but no popcorn in sight.</p>
<p>And I choose to let them watch. </p>
<p>After all, I did the same with Dawn. I spied on her. I can&#x27;t blame my pokemon for wanting to do the same. And as weird as it might be to have my pokemon interested in me like that, it&#x27;s not like forcing them to look away would solve that.</p>
<p>But I could really do without their commentary...</p>
<p>~&quot;Nice.&quot; Says Salandit as I remove my final piece of clothing.</p>
<p>~&quot;He can grow larger?&quot; Asks Buneary.</p>
<p>... I ended up with an erection.</p>
<p>As fast as lightning, I move the towel in place to hide my shameful state.</p>
<p>~&quot;Don&#x27;t you know anything?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I know how to battle, do you!?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Of coursse he can grow larger.&quot; Salandit ignores the taunt and manages to anger Buneary even more. ~&quot;He iss getting ready for mating. I wonder who he plans to take firsst?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop fighting.&quot; And stop commenting about my dick!</p>
<p>Maria then gives us a thorough look-over before instructing us to lie down and to start relaxing.</p>
<p>She begins the massage with me.</p>
<p>Her oily hands knead through my back and I&#x27;m surprised at how nice it feels. Her palms dig through my tense muscles but... the sounds of effort she makes in the process... They are creating more tensions somewhere else.</p>
<p>&quot;You are very tense. Have you tried relaxing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve never seen him relax before. Ever. I&#x27;m not sure he can do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there&#x27;s your problem. Go and try relaxing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying as hard as I can!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try less hard. Until you figure it out, I will just need to use a little more force on you.&quot;</p>
<p>What does she mean by that?</p>
<p>Oh? A weight settles on top of my ass and thighs. Did she straddle me? There is just a thin layer of fabric separating us now.</p>
<p>Her knuckles and elbows continue the labor. &quot;Oof, oh damn! That feels so good.&quot; </p>
<p>Oh man, this is so fucking good...</p>
<p>The way her hands move and press all over my back is just so unbelievably pleasant. </p>
<p>&quot;Wow! How are you doing that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have very, <em>very</em> skilled fingers, if you know what I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t care right now because I am in heaven.</p>
<p>She moves over to my neck and shoulders... It feels like the weight of the whole world is being lifted off of them for just this moment.</p>
<p>Then my arms... Then my legs and ass... </p>
<p>I feel as I am close to passing out from relaxation.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s going on anymore. Don&#x27;t question when she tells me to turn over or to keep the towel in place.</p>
<p>Or ask about the &#x27;happy end&#x27; that she offers. I couldn&#x27;t even bring my body to let out a single response.</p>
<p>I like Maria. She&#x27;s cool.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Consciousness floods back to me and I look around in disappointment. My massage is already over.</p>
<p>Dawn lies on her stomach on another massage table. The weight of her body squeezes her boobs towards the sides.</p>
<p>Each press by Maria squishes her boobs further into the table and elicits quiet, suppressed moans out of Dawn.</p>
<p>Sweet Mew, that&#x27;s so hot.</p>
<p>As if Dawn heard that, she turns her head to look at me.</p>
<p>In an instant her face grows red but then her eyes travel down my body and her blush grows even deeper. Her eyes dilate and she turns away just as quickly as her blush appeared.</p>
<p>Glimpses of her bright red ears peek past the mess of her hair. Every once in a while her eye finds a way to blink at me some more.</p>
<p>While Maria continues to treat Dawn, Salandit and Buneary have taken my relaxed position as an invitation to settle themselves on my stomach and chest.</p>
<p>Salandit tried going too far of course, but I&#x27;m drawing the line for her this time. I can&#x27;t have her... play around in a way that might cause... an accident.</p>
<p>Eventually Dawn turns over on her back and Maria massages her stomach, thighs and neck.</p>
<p>... Arceus, I wish that was me.</p>
<p>Maybe I could talk Akari or Zoey into trying that?</p>
<p>... Maria fixes Dawn&#x27;s hair...</p>
<p>I spend the time by petting my pokemon and Lucario&#x27;s egg.</p>
<p>Maybe I could try massaging my pokemon? I bet they would enjoy it too!</p>
<p>The anatomy book could teach me more about their muscles and aren&#x27;t massages beneficial for muscle growth? If so, then delaying it any further would be a travesty!</p>
<p>... Yes. I think giving my pokemon a massage is a great idea.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Swole, let&#x27;s go. We can use the hot tub now.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn pulls me out of my daydreams of pokemon who are panting, sweating and moaning under my hands.</p>
<p>I swing my legs over the table to get going but after a few steps, I notice that Dawn stopped walking the moment I got up.</p>
<p>&quot;Dawn? Aren&#x27;t you coming?&quot;</p>
<p>She looks like a Deerling in front of headlights. Mawile tries to hide her face behind her horn.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, I believe the FKK section is on the 5th floor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;FKK?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nudists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... Oh!&quot;</p>
<p>I quickly cover up my junk... My hands are too small for the task.</p>
<p>I quickly take my towel back out of Salandit&#x27;s claws and wrap it around my waist.</p>
<p>This is so embarrassing!</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot; How did I not even notice that my towel fell off? Am I dumb? &quot;L-let&#x27;s just get going.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Maria said we couldn&#x27;t keep the towels on in the hot tub. </p>
<p>She was adamant about it. She told it with a sadistic smile on her face. For a moment she reminded me of Meowth that plays with their food before devouring it.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, it turned out to be a very awkward bath.</p>
<p>The whole time I tried to look at Dawn&#x27;s bits and pieces through the bubble bath, while trying to appear as if I wasn&#x27;t doing exactly that.</p>
<p>And I caught Dawn&#x27;s eyes moving to certain places on me. Which means my inconspicuous staring was probably caught too.</p>
<p>At some point my pokemon began cat-calling me with various comments about my dick again and they kept trying to move too close for comfort.</p>
<p>When it finally came to an end, we returned to the bar to get some sparkling water to drink. Beth wasn&#x27;t there at first and only returned after ringing the service bell a few times.</p>
<p>Then she gave us alcohol by accident but we ignored her mistake and drank it anyway.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was wasted away under the sun near the pool. Nothing really was going on there.</p>
<p>Occasionally a trainer came, got something to drink, talked with us for a moment and left again.</p>
<p>And now, it&#x27;s time for dinner.</p>
<p><em>Don&#x27;t eat the food!</em></p>
<p>But the options aren&#x27;t good enough for my pokemon.</p>
<p>&quot;Spaghetti carbonara and desserts...&quot; That&#x27;s really just empty calories.</p>
<p>We already skipped training today. Can&#x27;t have my pokemon eat junk-food too. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Buneary and Salandit. Today we&#x27;re going to eat the rest of the pellets. I will make you something extra nice tomorrow, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t seem to mind my decision as much as I had feared.</p>
<p>Dawn and I find an empty table in the dining room with a decent look at a stage where we are supposed to get some form of entertainment while we eat.</p>
<p>A blonde service woman with beautiful violet eyes and a large decollete arrives at our table and delivers our food before leaving again.</p>
<p>I quietly toss the food inside a Dupperware box and store it in my backpack. It&#x27;s going to rot in there before I can eat it but it&#x27;s better optics than just throwing their food away.</p>
<p>&quot;It tastes a little off...&quot; Dawn chews through her meal slowly.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t look all too appetizing either. The sauce is runny and the egg didn&#x27;t mix properly with the sauce. &quot;Isn&#x27;t this a luxury cruise ship? How can they deliver that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because of their staff shortage?&quot; She forces another few bites down.</p>
<p>Only blondes work on the ship. Another one, dressed like an exotic belly-dancer, arrives on the stage to dance while we continue our meals.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re not allowed to watch that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Why? I&#x27;m a free man!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish...&quot; She mumbles before saying out loud. &quot;Ha. Ha. No you&#x27;re not. You&#x27;re engaged.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t think of anything in response so I just eat my pokemon-pellets in bored silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to watch the sunset with me after this?&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn puts the last bit of carbonara in her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. But you know... I think I&#x27;d rather watch you, <em>Dawn</em>.&quot; Heh.</p>
<p>She inhales a piece of her food and starts coughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Jerk.&quot;</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>I liked the ferry more. At least we could get to the most important part of a ship for any romance: The bow.</p>
<p>Now we&#x27;re just standing on the west side of the ship, looking out to the horizon. The sun slowly sets.</p>
<p>Dawn returned Prinplup and Mawile to their balls because they complained about being too tired on the way here. Even though she herself was yawning up a storm she still remains determined to try and stay awake for this.</p>
<p>It might very well be the only sunset we&#x27;re going to see from the sea on our whole tour across Sinnoh, so it&#x27;s understandable why Dawn would want to stay awake for it.</p>
<p>Sleep is trying to catch up with me as well though. We really didn&#x27;t get enough sleep last night.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Yawn</em>. You know how long until the sunset starts?&quot; Dawn asks.</p>
<p>There is a trick to measure time to sunset with fingers on an outstretched arm.</p>
<p>&quot;45 minutes. A little less actually.&quot;</p>
<p>The sky is beautiful right now. A slight discoloration has begun to appear and the clouds have a picturesque shape. The left and right side of the horizon is framed in large columns of clouds while the sun goes down between them.</p>
<p>Almost as if the universe was trying to create the perfect moment for us.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I-- <em>Yawn</em>. Can I lean a little on you?&quot; Dawn asks but doesn&#x27;t wait for a reply.</p>
<p>I smell the conditioner Maria put in her hair as she rests her head on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;I like what Maria did with your hair. You should wear it more often like that.&quot;</p>
<p>It is styled in a &#x27;Half-Up, Half-Down&#x27;. A style where half of her dark blue hair is bound up in a complex braid along the back of her head, while the other half flows down freely.</p>
<p>Despite the sleepiness in her eyes it&#x27;s giving her a very energetic look.</p>
<p>The low sunlight reflects in glittering sparkles from her eyes and her eyeliner makes it impossible to look away.</p>
<p>Her lips are also glossy and pink. I- I really want to kiss her.</p>
<p>&quot;Dawn--&quot; - &quot;Swole--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You go ahead.&quot; I say and she turns her head to look at me.</p>
<p>Her face is just inches away from mine. Our lips, so close from touching each other. Her cheeks are red.</p>
<p>&quot;Swole... I-- I&#x27;m not feeling so good...&quot; Her head goes limp and falls against my chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Dawn? What&#x27;s going on? Hey?&quot;</p>
<p>Seasickness? Fatigue? Food poisoning?</p>
<p>Her head doesn&#x27;t feel warm. No fever.</p>
<p>&quot;Will, <em>yaawn</em>, will you... like, bring me to my room? ... Or something... <em>Yawn</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want a Pecha Berry in case of food poisoning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nah... I&#x27;m just really tired... <em>Yawn</em> I couldn&#x27;t really sleep. Haha... Don&#x27;t worry about me... You already worry enough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright. If that makes you feel better.&quot;</p>
<p>The sunset is still almost half an hour off.</p>
<p>Poor Dawn... And she looked forward to this so much.</p>
<p>Her arm hangs over my shoulder as I carry her to her room where she stumbles the rest of the way to bed and falls face forward.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t imagine that position to be comfortable, so I gently move her onto her back and see that she is already fast asleep.</p>
<p>Carefully, I remove her bag, jacket, belt and boots, placing them neatly next to her bed.</p>
<p>Knowing she wears an undershirt, I feel comfortable taking off her black over-shirt but stop after that. Dawn will probably be annoyed with the creases in her skirt tomorrow, but I&#x27;m not going to remove that either.</p>
<p>I have enough decency as a man not to take advantage of a helpless woman... But I still lift her skirt for just a moment. Nothing I haven&#x27;t seen before but it&#x27;s just too intriguing to ignore.</p>
<p>Before covering her with the blanket and leaving the room, I give her forehead a gentle goodnight kiss.</p>
<p>Is it safe enough to leave the door unlocked?</p>
<p>... No way. Too many valuables and who knows what a stranger would do to her.</p>
<p>I borrow the key she kept in her jacket pocket and leave the room before locking the door from the outside and squeezing the key back through the slit under the door.</p>
<p>Great. And Buneary can just break her door down in an emergency.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s perfectly safe now.</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>I cross to the other side of the hallway, return to my room, lock the door and put Riolu on the pillow of the bed.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty tired, but my pokemon aren&#x27;t. They didn&#x27;t have any trouble sleeping last night. And it wouldn&#x27;t be right to send them to sleep just because of my needs.</p>
<p>So I pull out &#x27;Joyful Pokemon Anatomy&#x27; and skim through the chapter index.</p>
<p>There are a lot of chapters that I really don&#x27;t want to look at. Like &#x27;Reproductive organs&#x27; or &#x27;Secondary sex organs&#x27;.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to have to read that at some point for their health checkup... But I have enough other stuff on my plate for now.</p>
<p>I memorize the page number for pokemon&#x27;s muscle groups and flip open the book randomly, somewhere in the middle to get to the page faster--</p>
<p>How? Just... How... </p>
<p>Somehow, I got a face-full of spread-open pokemon pussy. I quickly leaf away from the random page, before the image burns itself into my memory any more than necessary.</p>
<p>I find the chapter I was looking for and give it a quick read. It gives very detailed information on how muscles work, how to detect if there&#x27;s anything wrong with them and what the differences are between different body types.</p>
<p>Humanoid shapes are almost exactly like humans. Salandit fits into the category of quadrupeds but she is a plantigrade - meaning her knees bend in the same direction as human knees.</p>
<p>Salandit should have stronger back, abs and oblique muscles and they can sustain more pressure. While Buneary should have stronger legs, shoulders and arms.</p>
<p>I guess I can start working with that info.</p>
<p>&quot;Who wants to get a massage first?&quot; I ask my pokemon and regret it immediately.</p>
<p>~&quot;Me! Me! Touch me!&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I don&#x27;t want the lizard to be first!&quot;</p>
<p>Good grief.</p>
<p>&quot;Salandit, you&#x27;re up first. Supposedly, your back can take more damage; So I don&#x27;t need to be afraid of accidentally hurting you somehow.&quot; </p>
<p>Which in itself is unlikely, since pokemon are way too durable for that.</p>
<p>~&quot;Yesss! Ssuck it, rabbit!&quot; Salandit hops on my lap and manages to toss the book aside.</p>
<p>&quot;Grrrrr!&quot;</p>
<p>I pick Salandit back up and lie her down on the bed, then put the book next to her for reference and finally put some of Salandit&#x27;s grooming oil on my hands.</p>
<p>Maria started her massage on my lower back, so I just copy the order she did it in.</p>
<p>I place my hands on her back. Where her spine meets her pelvis and extends into her tail. It&#x27;s also where the stripe of her igniphores branch out to cover more surface area.</p>
<p>It feels very hot to my touch and Salandit&#x27;s tail starts wagging as soon as my hands meet her skin.</p>
<p>With a tiny bit of pressure at first, I start to massage her in circles.</p>
<p>~&quot;Do me harder.&quot; She hisses out.</p>
<p>And while I know that she said it like this specifically to mess with me, I still increase the pressure.</p>
<p>Her tail wags faster and her igniphores get a little hotter. I hope she won&#x27;t set the bed on fire.</p>
<p>I move up her back and she starts panting and... growling? No, purring? Holy shit, that&#x27;s so cute!</p>
<p>And the harder I press, the harder she purrs. Cute!</p>
<p>When I switch over to her shoulders and arms, her tongue keeps darting out, trying to lick my wrists. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s surprisingly nice to do this. It&#x27;s almost the same as petting, just a little more... Intimate.</p>
<p>A lot more intimate, actually.</p>
<p>We already do petting, cuddling and bathing together. I might be going too far with this.</p>
<p>Am I making a mistake?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m enabling their attraction to me. But the thought of not doing this stuff with my pokemon anymore... It hurts.</p>
<p>I love my pokemon, I want to be there for them, I want them to be happy, healthy and fulfilled.</p>
<p>They are my friends and my family. And... if it came down to it... I think I would give them what they want.</p>
<p>My own happiness doesn&#x27;t matter as much as theirs.</p>
<p>I finish massaging Salandit&#x27;s arms and move down to her flanks and legs.</p>
<p>She has more muscles there than around her shoulders. On humans, it would mean that she has a nice ass...</p>
<p>Buneary too. They both have incredible bodies for their species. Buneary&#x27;s only physical blemishes are her scars but they will disappear when she evolves.</p>
<p>My pokemon are on their way to reach peak physical perfection.</p>
<p>Salandit breathes raggedly as I turn her over to massage her stomach and her obliques. Maria had also massaged my chest if I remember correctly despite the foggy memories...</p>
<p>Droplets of sweat form on her body. Salandit&#x27;s unique natural smell enters my nose. She smells of citrus, strawberry and licorice. A similar aroma to her grooming oils.</p>
<p>Her stomach is a little softer compared to the rest of her body. She has finally gained a slim layer of fat at some point but I can still feel her solid abs through the layer. Which means she is at a perfectly healthy level.</p>
<p>~&quot;More... pleassse.&quot;</p>
<p>Her breathing is erratic, her tail wags with wild abandon and her tongue lolls out. She has clearly gotten very excited from this.</p>
<p>Only her chest is left... A place where I have already found out that she has a pair of sensitive nipples.</p>
<p>&quot;Y-you...&quot; There won&#x27;t be any turning back if I do this. &quot;You did a... A good job at the gym.&quot;</p>
<p>I move my hands the final distance up her chest. I cup her... Her breasts, really.</p>
<p>Her breath hitches and her eyes widen. She stares into mine with disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;Sala?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bune?&quot;</p>
<p>Salandit&#x27;s barely visible nipples have stiffened in the centers of my palms. They feel... interesting.</p>
<p>My thumbs brush over them to get a better feel. </p>
<p>Her purring gets a lot louder and her tail tries to wrap around my leg. But it&#x27;s too short for the job.</p>
<p>They feel nubby, warm, hot actually and have a slight stiffness to them. Her breasts have a more noticeable give to them, even when compared to her stomach.</p>
<p>Her breathing quickens and intensifies as I touch and rub her nipples more. </p>
<p>I wonder if she tastes the same way she smells... </p>
<p>Tha- That would be taking things too far! This is just a reward for her. Not very different than a... I dunno.</p>
<p>Her body relaxes more and more, becoming like putty in my hands as her panting increases in intensity.</p>
<p>She stares deeply into my eyes and her long tongue seeks out to tickle my hands or whatever gets close enough to her mouth.</p>
<p>~&quot;<strong>YESSSS!</strong>&quot; </p>
<p>All of a sudden, her body tenses up and her natural smell becomes even more noticeable. There is a clearly wet spot on her lower body, where I try my hardest to look away from.</p>
<p>She leans her head into my hand and I pet her a little while she calms down again. Her breathing still comes out in short, rapid breaths and her eyes are dilated and locked into mine.</p>
<p>~&quot;Thankss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t mention it. Please.&quot; </p>
<p>Whatever happens in this room, stays in this room.</p>
<p>&quot;This won&#x27;t become a habit. This is a special reward for being an exceptional pokemon and for doing an incredible job at the gym. You two got that?&quot;</p>
<p>Salandit looks a bit sad about it. But in the end, the happiness from the massage outweighs it and she lies down on the bed and just watches me and Buneary.</p>
<p>... Wait. &#x27;End&#x27;... &#x27;Happiness&#x27;... </p>
<p>Poke-Web: &quot;what&#x27;s a happy end for massages?&quot;</p>
<p>No signal... Damn it! But I can guess what it means now.</p>
<p>I could have gotten that from Maria!? Damn it! Why am I so ignorant!?</p>
<p>Anyway, I look towards Buneary.</p>
<p>&quot;Now... It&#x27;s your turn for a massage-- Hey, what&#x27;s going on?&quot;</p>
