<p>&quot;Thanks for the lift, Andrew!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any time, Swole. But are you sure you don&#x27;t want to have a friendly match against me?&quot;</p>
<p>The fisherman quickly secures the equipment within his little fishing boat. The trip across the lake near Eterna City was smooth sailing; only the landing on the shore was rather rocky.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>&quot;I bet my six Magikarp could give you a run for your money! Hahaha!&quot;</p>
<p>He steps out after me to stretch his arms above his head but nearly stumbles on the uneven rocks.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sure they would, but I&#x27;ve gotta get a move on. I have girls waiting for me, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm.&quot; He nods sagely. &quot;Me too. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m out here, ahahaha! Alright, don&#x27;t let me hold you up. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget your Joltik!&quot;</p>
<p>The little yellow spider has attached himself to the back of the boat. Once spotted, he dashes off towards the nearby tall grass.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. I think your pokemon ran away just now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. He&#x27;s just a wild pokemon who has been following me.&quot; I begin walking off while waving. &quot;Goodbye, Andrew.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the path of Route 205 - the final stretch towards Eterna City.</p>
<p>&quot;Bye-bye!&quot; Andrew returns the wave before pushing his boat back into the water, where waves ripple out.</p>
<p>The looming city skyline in the distance grows larger as I approach.</p>
<p>Towering trees that make up the canopy of Eterna Forest have given way to just a scarce few bushes and shrubs along the roadside with tall grass growing between them, all bathed in bright sunlight.</p>
<p>The days I spent underground and in the dark and dusky forest have thoroughly defeated my sense of time. I have no idea what day it is. The only thing I know is that it feels like summer. Maybe 20 degrees Celsius?</p>
<p>So I, as a born and bred Sinnohian walk from shade to shade to avoid the stinging heat... Just kidding.</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s weather is lovely. The heat on my face feels like a pleasant break from the grueling days I have been through. I even go out of my way to avoid the shadows along the path to soak up more sun.</p>
<p>Salandit does the same on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you looking forward to enjoying some real civilization again? It&#x27;s just a few hundred meters more!&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Meh.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Eh.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Don&#x27;t really care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sewaddle.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly, they don&#x27;t share my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&quot;You girls couldn&#x27;t care less about how much luxury surrounds you, right?&quot; They give a round of confirmations. &quot;But I look forward to it. Because it means I can see Dawn, Akari, and Zoey soon! And I can call my mom!&quot;</p>
<p>... But they must not know what really happened.</p>
<p>Eh. Who cares? I can talk with them again, and that&#x27;s what truly matters!</p>
<p>&quot;Sewaddle, have you ever been in a human town or city?&quot;</p>
<p>She shakes her tiny head.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s going to be great! Some places have a few too many people, but overall, cities are where you can get anything you could ever want!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sewa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! Anything! And I will get my third gym badge there! It will be a four-versus-four battle, so we are going to train a lot!&quot;</p>
<p>The city will be filled to the brim with all sorts of distractions that can stop me from thinking too much.</p>
<p>Maybe I can even find a reason to drink again?</p>
<p>And speaking of distractions: &quot;Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you not planning to greet me?&quot;</p>
<p>Holy hell! &quot;Typhlosion?!&quot; I didn&#x27;t see her there! &quot;You evolved again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the first thing you notice?&quot; Akari&#x27;s voice prompts my eyes to leave Typhlosion&#x27;s mischievous gaze.</p>
<p>There she is, standing in front of her pokemon.</p>
<p>They are wearing matching colors. Akari&#x27;s short kimono is a deep purple and transitions into bright red flames near the hem of her skirt. Her leggings are the same beige as the fur on Typhlosion&#x27;s belly, while the fire around her neck matches the hem on Akari&#x27;s clothes.</p>
<p>Wait... &quot;Akari?!&quot;</p>
<p>I run at her and squeeze her tightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! Calm down!&quot; She screams for her life as we twirl on the spot, swinging her around me. &quot;Ahhh! I&#x27;m not going to run away! Ahhh! Let me down!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let you Dawn? Where is she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! Stooop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hahaha! Alright.&quot; She continues to spin for a bit after I let her go. &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen you in forever! How are you doing? How are your pokemon doing? Did you catch any new ones? How is Marley doing? You didn&#x27;t hurt yourself on your travels, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you say?&quot; Her eyes are still unfocused, and Typhlosion laughs joyfully over her trainer&#x27;s plight.</p>
<p>Typhlosion looks a little weird. Her colors are all off. Is she sick? Lopunny squares up against her until Typhlosion backs off.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you?&quot; I repeat for Akari once I spot her eyes homing in on me.</p>
<p>&quot;I am doing fine, thank you for asking, dear fiancé.&quot; She walks to my free side, hooking her arm around mine. &quot;Let&#x27;s walk into the city together, shall we?&quot;</p>
<p>Akari is adorable.</p>
<p>Her head only reaches my chin, even though she is a year older than me, so I have to bend down to give her a kiss on the cheek. &quot;I have missed you.&quot;</p>
<p>She just turns her head away and mumbles something incoherent while a blush spreads on her face. &quot;Let&#x27;s just go for now...&quot; We get moving.</p>
<p>Once her blush receded, she asked how I was doing. I gave her a vague response for now. There is too much to talk about. Besides, I kinda don&#x27;t want to talk about it anymore. I just want to enjoy the moment with her.</p>
<p>But I can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>My foot catches on something on the road, causing us both to stumble to the ground in one big heap.</p>
<p>Somehow, almost as if forced by fate, I land on my back while Akari falls down on top of me.</p>
<p>She wears a cute expression on her face as she stares down at me with adrenaline-fueled shock. She pants a few times before speaking. &quot;Thank you for catching me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gladly. Sorry, I stumbled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t your fault. I am sure I know exactly who to blame.&quot; Quiet, cackling laughter comes from her shadow. &quot;Zoroark has become frisky ever since she evolved. Let&#x27;s just get up and--&quot;</p>
<p>I put my arm around her back, stopping her from getting up.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s stay like this a little bit.&quot; I suggest as I rub my hand up and down her back. &quot;I like your warmth on top of me, and I&#x27;m feeling rather frisky myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Iep!&quot; Steam comes off her head when she squeaks. &quot;Okay!&quot; She mumbles to herself, &quot;Dear mother, I am sorry. I am weak to temptation... This is all it took for me to become a harlot like Zoey...&quot;</p>
<p>She relaxes into my embrace-- &quot;No. I refuse to stoop so low!&quot;</p>
<p>After summoning a surprising amount of strength, she breaks my hold and frees herself.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s quick to her feet, patting down her clothes. &quot;Let us go explore the city. That way we can enjoy some time together without diving into debauchery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tis is no laughing matter!&quot;</p>
<p>I laugh even more, losing myself in her glaring blue eyes. She looks just like Dawn, staring down at me with slowly fading anger.</p>
<p>As soon as my attention shifts away from Akari&#x27;s beautiful face and her entrancing blue eyes, I realize we&#x27;re already right in front of the city.</p>
<p>Just a few meters ahead, the road transitions from packed dirt to cobbled stone, and after just a few dozen meters to asphalt with towering buildings looming on either side of the street: giants of concrete and steel - the kind that would be better suited for Canalave City - with rows of trees enjoying the light bouncing between the windows.</p>
<p>A passerby walking up to his apartment complex spots me on the ground before shaking his head with a smile and a roll of his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know any nice places yet?&quot;</p>
<p>Akari offers her hand to help me up. &quot;No. I wanted to wait for you. Exploring will be more fun together.&quot; A kind smile graces her lips. &quot;So far, I only know of a cheap place to stay the night and a cafe where Marley said she would be most of the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Incredible. Her soft smile, her warm fingers within my hand, and her bangs draping over her face while she pulls me up - she&#x27;s perfect.</p>
<p>With my free hand, I gently brush the strands aside before leading the way.</p>
<p>Our aimless trek between the city&#x27;s towering behemoths is bound to bring us to the pokemon center as long as we simply follow the main streets.</p>
<p>&quot;Akari?&quot; Redundant. She never stopped paying attention to me. </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long did you wait for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A few days. I had a feeling you would come through the forest and waited here for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A few days?! I am so sorry I made you wait so long--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just kidding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I used aura to locate you and figure out when you&#x27;d be here. I only waited 10 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ha ha.&quot; She smiles brightly when I let out the driest laugh I can manage. &quot;It was still very sweet of you to pick me up. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t mention it.&quot; She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear, her gaze dropping for a moment. &quot;It&#x27;s the least I should be doing. Instead of helping or supporting you, I&#x27;m always away. And I will need to leave again in a few days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmhm.&quot; She nods and points at an ominous building to our left. &quot;Your father is looking for workers right now. As soon as we have enough, we will build a new town on Route 218.&quot;</p>
<p>Very ominous. A tall, blue facade with mean-looking spikes. Team Galactic&#x27;s logo stands proudly, facing the street and telling everyone that this fortress belongs to them.</p>
<p>The nearby industry seems to cater to the workers inside. Restaurants are plenty; one group of office workers in Team Galactic grunt uniforms can be seen through a window in the building on the opposite side of the street.</p>
<p>A sign advertises a steakhouse on the ground floor and a rooftop cafe on top. At night, both locations become nightclubs.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know how much time you still have? We could visit that place some night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have a few days at least. We can go there if you want.&quot; She continues the stroll. This time, I follow. &quot;But aren&#x27;t those places usually filled with debauchery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhhh, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve never been to a nightclub before.&quot;</p>
<p>We walk for a bit in silence, reminding me of our first non-date in Jubilife City. Except this time it doesn&#x27;t feel as awkward. It feels nice.</p>
<p>A few more passersby stare at us. Probably wondering why Lopunny copies Akari&#x27;s behavior.</p>
<p>Girls - Akari and Lopunny - have hooked themselves around my arms on both sides, there are pokemon on both of my shoulders, and Sewaddle has squeezed herself into a spot on my arm as well.</p>
<p>Truly a weird sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Akari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How come you are clean and not rancid like a trainer should be after disappearing in Oreburgh City and reappearing in the Eterna Forest? Not that you will see me complain. It is merely a pleasant observation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I stumbled across a mansion in the middle of nowhere. It turned out it was full of ghosts.&quot;</p>
<p>She doesn&#x27;t believe me.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m telling the truth. You see, my bizarre adventure started when a storm brewed itself together at the horizon...&quot;</p>
<p>And so, Akari listens to my tale while I keep an eye out for the familiar orange of the pokemon center.</p>
<p>She listens attentively, touching me compassionately as I tell her everything without holding back: the story of Mary the maid.</p>
<p>But also of Rupert, Gregory, Alfred, little Nina, and her ugly mother. And of Victor.</p>
<p>I confess that I developed a crush on Mary. I briefly mention the brutality and inhumanity of her demise.</p>
<p>... In the end, Mom was right once again. Talking about it does make me feel slightly better.</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>&quot;Your pokemon are as healthy as they can be, Mister Solo.&quot; Nurse Joy says with a slight bow of her head. &quot;Farewell, and please feel free to come back anytime.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You too-- I mean, thank you. And goodbye.&quot; She chuckles as I quickly retreat from the scene.</p>
<p><em>You too?</em> Am I stupid? Argh!</p>
<p>Akari and Typhlosion hold a hand and paw in front of their faces. They are chuckling in perfect sync with each other.</p>
<p>&quot;You too?&quot; Akari repeats my words.</p>
<p>My face heats up in embarrassment.</p>
<p>At least my own pokemon couldn&#x27;t hear it since they are still inside their pokeballs.</p>
<p>Including Sewaddle. For some reason the perhaps thousand-year-old Friend Ball is compatible with TMs. Nurse Joy&#x27;s machine was even able to scan it somehow and register it under my trainer ID.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all to me. &quot;Akari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Swole?&quot; She straightens up, pretending that she doesn&#x27;t find my faux pas funny, but a few chuckles still escape. &quot;At least you didn&#x27;t say, <em>Thanks, Mom.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Her resemblance with Dawn is truly uncanny.</p>
<p>I can only shake my head. &quot;Remember how you gave me your Protect TM?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. It is our dowry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t need it because it wasn&#x27;t compatible with your 300-year-old pokeballs, right?&quot;</p>
<p>She nods, moving a wild strand of hair back into its place behind her ear. &quot;And I knew it would be useful to you. The perfect dowry.&quot; The ring I got her in Canalave City sparkles on her finger as she removes her hand from her face.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re right. And I&#x27;m grateful for it. It really saved my hide in a couple of matches. But don&#x27;t you think it&#x27;s weird that the much older pokeball is more modern than yours?&quot;</p>
<p>She bobs her head up and down. The wild strand escapes once more. I see why she used to wear a headscarf at all times. &quot;It is very strange. Why do you think that is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure...&quot;</p>
<p>I start moving out of the pokemon center, releasing my pokemon from their balls and picking up a city brochure on the way out.</p>
<p>We walk through the bustling city once more, weaving through sparse crowds and past an occasional car. This time, I&#x27;m looking for the gym.</p>
<p>&quot;... One thing Victor said stands out to me. Technology keeps disappearing only to reemerge later. Perhaps you used to live at a time between two periods of advancement?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could be.&quot; She nods. &quot;The school tournament was the first time I heard of a TM. What causes this? Perhaps the time travelers like Lucas and Ingo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ingo?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another time traveler in our village. He claims to originally be from the Unova region.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah. So in the end, Dialga and Palkia are at fault. Oh! Hey, look! It&#x27;s the gym.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks at it, tilting her head a bit to make sure she&#x27;s seeing it right. &quot;It looks like a garden to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. Eterna City&#x27;s gym is inside the middle of a botanical garden. Trainers within are free to take simple strolls or battle to their heart&#x27;s content. Training there is not an option, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because the gym assistants are going to spy on my ideas, and then they plan against me in battle.&quot;</p>
<p>A pair of fake Sudowoodo stand guard at the entrance to the property. There is no fence; people could enter from any direction at any time, but the Sudowoodo make it clear that this right here is the intended entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;I see. You&#x27;re being cautious.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn would have called me paranoid. &quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>Between the two statues is a path that leads deeper into a lush and densely packed garden with plants and pokemon everywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; Akari suddenly shouts when we pass the statues. &quot;The one on the right moved!&quot;</p>
<p>But the longer I look at him, the more obvious it becomes that he is just a statue.</p>
<p>I turn around only to see Akari and all our pokemon holding in their laughter. Typhlosion still does the thing with the fire around her neck whenever she tries not to laugh. It&#x27;s like a countdown until she breaks.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha. Ha. Very funny. Careful, Akari, the Sudowoodo behind your back is about to attack you.&quot;</p>
<p>She just laughs some more. &quot;Really? Playing the same joke back at me?&quot; </p>
<p>She should have believed me.</p>
<p>The pokemon actually moves. Slowly, like a praying mantis, he steps off the podium, inching closer to Akari. He readies his branch-like arm to tap Akari on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Any second now...</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh!&quot; She screams and jumps forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; I do the same after feeling a touch against my shoulder.</p>
<p>They were both real!</p>
<p>The Sudowoodo roll around in laughter while we try to catch our breaths.</p>
<p>Eventually, Akari&#x27;s heavy breathing turns into laughter, infecting me with it. And after a while, we continue inside the botanical garden, walking hand in hand.</p>
<p>Akari enjoys the scenery, the plants, flowers, and friendly frolicking pokemon... but I cannot. My paranoia senses have flared up with the first step inside.</p>
<p>That girl over there is glaring at me. She stands at the bend of a cobbled path looking at me as she clenches her fists. And now she&#x27;s pretending to look at the flowers.</p>
<p>She has flaming red hair, and her face is covered in freckles.</p>
<p>Wait, that&#x27;s not just a random flower she&#x27;s looking at; it&#x27;s a Maractus! That pokemon pretends to be a flowering cactus!</p>
<p>I keep looking back as Akari leads us deeper into foreign territory, expecting her to turn towards me or attack me at any moment. Once she is out of sight, another one stands out. </p>
<p>This woman wears an afro on her head that is white as snow and puffed up like a large beach volleyball.</p>
<p>I feel watched even though she has her back turned to us. As we walk past her - and as I check out her butt - it feels as if a pair of eyes follows my every move.</p>
<p>What is she even looking at the entire time? It&#x27;s just a rose. Why is she watching the rose as if it&#x27;s the most interesting thing since sliced bread?</p>
<p>~&quot;Master? Is everything alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny looks at me in concern after I sped up slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. Sure.&quot; I&#x27;m just overreacting.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just the stress catching up. Maybe we should have just gone to the place Akari is staying at. &quot;Akari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mind if we just stay in your room for the rest of the day as soon as we are done here?&quot;</p>
<p>She stops walking. &quot;We can turn around right now if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, never mind; you&#x27;re enjoying this, right? Let&#x27;s ignore what I said and continue.&quot;</p>
<p>She doesn&#x27;t move. Instead she just watches my face.</p>
<p>A lady in a yellow sundress passes us with a small child holding her hand... That&#x27;s not a child. That&#x27;s a Chespin with makeup and a wig! What the hell is going on?!</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going insane.</p>
<p>It was that weird hole I looked into, wasn&#x27;t it? The one in Alamos Town, when Dialga fired that beam and deleted a part of the town. The thing I saw on the other side turned me insane. I fucking knew it.</p>
<p>No. It&#x27;s just the stress. I... I just need to calm down and think rationally.</p>
<p>Why would someone dress up their pokemon as a child? It makes no sense. I didn&#x27;t see it right. Maybe it was just a trick of the light.</p>
<p>Hmm. Hmm. Yes. It was a child. I remember it clearly now.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s go to my hostel room.&quot; Akari pulls me back into the present. &quot;We can collect Marley on the way.&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? Now? No! &quot;Did I ruin it? I&#x27;m sorry, Akari. I didn&#x27;t want to kill your mood. We can continue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are exhausted, aren&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>She asks, and I shake my head. I try to look for some flowers or anything to redirect her attention, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve been fighting in a cave and wandering through the Grand Underground?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know the name of that place? I thought I was the first one down there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They wrote about it in the news. Some people went down the hole in Oreburgh City to look for you but couldn&#x27;t find you on account of a redirected river.&quot; Huh. &quot;You&#x27;ve been traveling the whole time. Take a break.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we don&#x27;t have long before you need to leave again. We should be spending time together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can spend it in my room. On separate beds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On separate beds?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. I&#x27;m not Zoey.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;You should listen to her, Swole.&quot; Riolu teams up with Akari.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to your pokemon, Swole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You understood what she said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I guessed it. Stop changing the topic. We&#x27;re going now.&quot; She begins to walk back the way we came, pulling at my hand, but my feet remain firmly rooted to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure? I don&#x27;t want to ruin the day for you.&quot;</p>
<p>She pulls slightly harder, barely managing to budge me. &quot;Yes. I&#x27;m sure. I am happy once you are happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? But I am happy if you are happy.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman with the white afro approaches with heavy stomps.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, I would be happy if you took a break.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh my Arceus, her hair is fake! It&#x27;s an Eldegoss! She put the cottony pokemon on her head as a wig! Why?!</p>
<p>&quot;Just go with her, stupid!&quot; The woman shouts before pushing me from behind, and the two of them try to get me to move. Unsuccessfully. &quot;Ugh. Men. Eldegoss, this idiot has a serious case of denseritis. Please use Aromatherapy to cure him.&quot;</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Suddenly a pink cloud of a sweet-smelling scent encases my head.</p>
<p>My eyes feel droopy.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; I hear Akari&#x27;s voice from a mile away as my feet move on their own.</p>
<p>Is the sun smiling today? Oh, how nice. I think it is. &quot;Hehe.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, look. It&#x27;s the other two women. The redhead with a Maractus and... uhhh... is it a woman with a child or a Chespin? I can&#x27;t tell.</p>
<p>Anyway, I give Akari a big, wet kiss on her cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you overdid it.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s so cute how adorable Akari is when she worries about me. &quot;You&#x27;re the best waifu.&quot;</p>
<p>She&#x27;s so selfless, and her pokemon are flourishing under her watch. Of anyone I could have hastily accepted to marry, she truly was the best choice.</p>
<p>Mwah. I gave her another smooch.</p>
<p>&quot;Aromatherapy can only relax the body.&quot; The tall woman with a wig explains. &quot;Everything else is just him pretending to be high.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nooo... I&#x27;m not pretending. I swear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also, Gardenia isn&#x27;t at the gym today. Come back on Monday if you want to register.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a gym assistant?!?&quot;</p>
<p>... Fuuuck. I messed up the pre-battle show!</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>&quot;Good afternoon, Marley.&quot; Akari continues to drag me along until I slump into a chair at a cafe&#x27;s table.</p>
<p>&quot;... What happened to him?&quot; Marley wears an almost entirely black dress. A white bow holds her raven-black hair up in a unique style.</p>
<p>Her half-closed eyes look either bored or she&#x27;s making bedroom eyes at me. Not sure.</p>
<p>A little Gothorita - the goth girl pokemon - sits on her lap, where she copies her motions and mimics her facial expressions to the best of her abilities.</p>
<p>&quot;He got hit by Aromatherapy.&quot;</p>
<p>Gothorita and Marley drink from their teacups in sync before tilting their heads at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;... That&#x27;s not what Aromatherapy does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s also pretending to be <em>high</em>. What does his height have to do with this, Marley?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Nothing. Don&#x27;t do drugs, Akari... So, what are we going to do all day?&quot;</p>
<p>She dips a cookie into her tea before eating it.</p>
<p>While the girls make some plans, I take another look around. We&#x27;ve reached the poorer part of town. Furthest away from the bustling streets of Team Galactic&#x27;s office complex, and the stores seem to represent that.</p>
<p>One diner has a basic paper sign hanging in front of it with simple black print: &#x27;Best cheap diner in Eterna City! You won&#x27;t find better! (For these prices)&#x27;</p>
<p>Next to it is what appears to be a hobby mining supplier. &#x27;Children yearn for the mines,&#x27; says their slogan.</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t have a huge storefront, but the few things on display show that their slogan is literal. Pickaxes - for adults and in child size - next to a poster-advert for explosives, can be seen through the window.</p>
<p>Between the buildings is an alley with a sign pointing into it that advertises a bicycle store. The path is just barely wide enough for a bicycle to fit through. A girl with blonde, twin-drill hair comes from the shaded path... Her eyes are violet.</p>
<p>... Is that Domino?</p>
<p>The woman walks with confident steps. High heels.</p>
<p>How many people are in Sinnoh with this hair and those eyes? Her face looks exactly like Domino&#x27;s too.</p>
<p>&quot;Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? &quot;What did you say, Akari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to go to the historical museum with me tomorrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not today?&quot; I look back to the woman, but she disappeared into the crowd of people walking along the roads.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we&#x27;d been over this before.&quot; Akari grabs my hand tightly. &quot;Today, you&#x27;re going to get some rest. And either way, the museum is closed until tomorrow. They had an attempted robbery, and Officer Jenny insisted they increase the security.&quot;</p>
<p>Attempted robbery... was it Domino? I can&#x27;t find her in the crowd anymore.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Marley told me. Weren&#x27;t you listening the whole time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. Sorry. I thought I saw someone. An enemy. By the way, Marley, where is your Growlithe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... He got a little too big for walkies around the city at all times... Come out, Arcanine.&quot;</p>
<p>She throws up her pokeball before an intimidating beast of a dog appears in the middle of the road. His orange pelt and luscious beige mane strike for an imposing pokemon.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s taller than me and easily four times as massive as I am.</p>
<p>My pokemon all startle back from his appearance, but as soon as they realize it was just the effect of Intimidate they calm down again. Except for Lopunny. </p>
<p>She steps up to the pokemon that is easily as tall as her, looking down on him with a scowl.</p>
<p>Only after Arcanine backs off does Lopunny return to my side.</p>
<p>Good grief. What a troublesome evolution.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get a Fire Stone?&quot; I remember clearly that Growlithe can only evolve with it.</p>
<p>&quot;... Your father gave me one...&quot; She shyly taps her fingers together while Gothorita copies the motion. When she gets up from her seat, her pokemon mimics the motions perfectly again.</p>
<p>They walk up to Arcanine before Gothorita&#x27;s eyes shine in a blue color. The two hover up and float on top of his back. &quot;We can go to the apartment now...&quot;</p>
<p>Lopunny, seeing a ride pokemon in action, turns her back to me, folding her hands behind her back. </p>
<p>~&quot;Hop on.&quot; She wants me to ride her.</p>
<p>&quot;No. That is ridiculous.&quot;</p>
<p>She pulls funny faces.</p>
<p>Akari pulls out one of her pokeballs before releasing a tiny Rufflet. The small bird pokemon looks like a chicken with extra fluffy - or rather <em>ruffled</em> - feathers around his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Once he evolves, Braviary will be my ride pokemon. How do you plan to travel?&quot; Akari brings up a good point.</p>
<p>&quot;None of my pokemon can be ridden. I guess I will get a bike?&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;All of your pokemon can be ridden.&quot; Salandit hisses in my ear and gets me to blush as the memories of Lopunny&#x27;s and my first - I meant only - time jump to the front of my mind.</p>
<p>&quot;What did she say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing! Just a joke. She always jokes around... ha.&quot;</p>
<p>Typhlosion repeats what Salandit said.</p>
<p>&quot;... Swole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Yes, Akari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... You shouldn&#x27;t let your pokemon hang out with Zoey so much. Her humor is terribly deviant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Sure.&quot; They are a lot worse than Zoey is. Salandit is by far the worst. </p>
<p>Also, I told them many times not to do that stuff in public. &quot;Salandit, you&#x27;re going in the ball for that.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Nooo--&quot; Her voice cuts off as the red beam carries her off into timeout. Her ball shuffles a few times, but then she calms down when she realizes how much luxury she gets inside her ball.</p>
<p>&quot;Was Rufflet your mystery egg?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I caught him on Route 218. In the area where I plan to build the town. Sliggoo, come out.&quot; Another pokeball pops open and a pink snail-like pokemon emerges.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow! It was a dragon type pokemon? That&#x27;s so cool!&quot;</p>
<p>Akari and Sliggoo both nod pridefully while Lopunny vies for my attention by posing at the edge of my vision.</p>
<p>&quot;But why is her shell so large? And made of metal? And Typhlosion&#x27;s fire and fur are the wrong color. And your Zorua was also white instead of black, right? Where is she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t need to be shy, Zoroark. Come show yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>From her shadow emerges a white shape with long, wispy hair that floats around as if with a mind of its own.</p>
<p>Hisui Zoroark.</p>
<p>Right! Now I remember! I had scanned her with my pokedex before: She is a Hisui regional variant, and she has a ghost and normal type.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, those wisps were to vent off her cuteness... That seems made up.</p>
<p>I should get a new scan.</p>
<p>&quot;Hisui Zoroark.&quot; The mechanical voice sounds out. &quot;The winsome fox pokemon. This pokemon cares deeply about others of its kind, and it will conjure terrifying illusions to keep its den and pack safe. Seeking to ease the burden of solitude, lonely trainers tell Zoroark to disguise themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Um, what?</p>
<p>&quot;With its disheveled white fur, it looks like an embodiment of purity. Heedless of its own safety, Zoroark overwhelms its mate with a cute energy so intense, it overheats Zoroark&#x27;s own body.&quot;</p>
<p>... &quot;I think my pokedex is broken.&quot;</p>
<p>The longer Zoroark stares at me, the brighter the blood-red parts of her fur become. She looks uncomfortable, sick almost. She must be really bad at handling attention.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s alright, Zoroark. You can return into the shadows.&quot; She retreats faster than I could blink.</p>
<p>Anyway, since my pokedex is already out, I decide to scan her other pokemon as well.</p>
<p>Hisui Typhlosion - ghost and fire.</p>
<p>Hisui Sliggoo - dragon and steel. </p>
<p>Only her Rufflet is not a Hisui variant - also, normal and flying type, like most bird pokemon.</p>
<p>I wonder if her team could beat mine.</p>
<p>Ghost is a very strong type against Lopunny... but Riolu and Salandit haven&#x27;t been slacking off either.</p>
<p>... Wait... None of my pokemon have been slacking! Why are all her pokemon evolving so quickly while mine don&#x27;t?! Lopunny is my only pokemon who managed to evolve yet!</p>
<p>&quot;Ahem... Akari?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is your team so strong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. The reason is simple. I--&quot;</p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p>&quot;-- and then Goomy evolved just hours before your father decided we had done enough.&quot;</p>
<p>We traveled to the apartment while she spoke and shared stories of her adventures on Route 218.</p>
<p>It is a nice room, for the low prices they are paying, at least. No mold or dust, except in the crevices behind the bed. The room next door was available, so I rented it. It is equally decent.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you doing better now?&quot; Akari&#x27;s voice is still filled with concern as she massages my scalp. Her story didn&#x27;t distract her enough from my issues.</p>
<p>Looking up at her face, I see an almost motherly smile peering down on me. Her lap is firm and full of hidden muscles. Still, the softness in her actions and words makes up for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost.&quot; I don&#x27;t want this to end.</p>
<p>&quot;... Now I&#x27;m really jealous.&quot; Marley complains from the top of the other bed, where she pets her pokemon.</p>
<p>Arcanine is too large to lie on her lap, and Gothorita insisted that Marley should lie down on her lap instead. They tell each other to lie on their laps at the same time, and they have made no progress since then.</p>
<p>In the end, she called out Zubat from another pokeball to scratch him while she bores holes into us.</p>
<p>A brief glimmer of smugness flitters across Akari&#x27;s face while she enjoys the comfort within Typhlosion&#x27;s hug from behind. &quot;I&#x27;m sure you can find a husband too, Marley.&quot; </p>
<p>She caressed my face when she said &#x27;husband.&#x27;.</p>
<p>Marley raises her voice just a little. &quot;I don&#x27;t want a husband! ... Yet! ... But I can&#x27;t even get a boyfriend...&quot;</p>
<p>Fearing becoming a target, I keep my mouth shut.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like watching a nature documentary play out in real life. Two bickering women in their natural habitat; if they acknowledge I am here right now, I will either startle them off or make them turn on me with claws and fangs.</p>
<p>&quot;What type of guy are you looking for? And did you ask your father-- Ah. Right. We&#x27;re in the same situation without parents to rely on.&quot;</p>
<p>Marley takes on a faraway look as she describes her perfect guy. &quot;... I want someone strong to protect me. Influential and good-looking too... If he&#x27;s also funny, that would be a dream.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you could ask Swole--&quot; Huh!? &quot;&#x27;s father to help you look for an option.&quot; Phew.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Marley stays still like a statue while she mulls the suggestion over.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think my father would play a good Cupid. If I asked him for help, he&#x27;d just tell me to do it myself.</p>
<p>&quot;... He was rather helpful.&quot; What?! The same guy who sent me into the wilderness alone? &quot;... He did give me a Fire Stone for Arcanine, and he gave you a small loan of a million pokedollars...&quot;</p>
<p>Are they still talking about my father? The same person I grew up with?</p>
<p>&quot;You should try it.&quot; Akari doesn&#x27;t stop massaging my scalp. &quot;Ben Solo seems like a nice person. I bet he would help you.&quot;</p>
<p>He shares the same name with my father.</p>
<p>&quot;... Isn&#x27;t it a little too old-fashioned?... Besides, he&#x27;s not my father...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you saying I&#x27;m old-fashioned for suggesting it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Akari... You&#x27;re the most old-fashioned person alive. You wear kimonos every day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you dress drab!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not!&quot; Gothorita copies her insulted motions perfectly. &quot;... Tell her, Swole!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well.&quot; Should I be honest or just agree with Akari? Marley already looks insulted enough, though. I don&#x27;t have it in me to side against her. &quot;Marly looks cute. Her style fits well with her personality.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw... Thanks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just means your personality is drab too.&quot; Akari counters. </p>
<p>All of a sudden, Marley&#x27;s shoe flies through the room, hitting my forehead.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry!... That was aimed at Akari!&quot;</p>
<p>If she wore high heels instead of boots, I could have lost an eye...</p>
<p>I toss it back.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; She dives to the side as the projectile was right on track to hit her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Go!&quot; Her pokemon does the same for no reason.</p>
<p>A blue shimmer surrounds Akari&#x27;s pillow together with Gothorita&#x27;s eyes while Marley grabs her own pillow for retaliation.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t want to start that, Marley.&quot; I get up from Akari&#x27;s lap to dig up my camping pillow from the backpack. &quot;Don&#x27;t start fights you won&#x27;t be able to win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... It&#x27;s two against one. Akari is too stuffy for a pillow fight...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah? But I am a guardian of aura.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... There is no way that makes such a huge difference!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> <em>One minute later.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Nooooo! Get off of me!... Gothorita, do something!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gooooth! Gothorita!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... I can&#x27;t get us out. I&#x27;m stuck! You need to do it!&quot;</p>
<p>I slap Gothorita with my pillow as soon as I see her eyes light up again.</p>
<p>&quot;Gothorita...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We surrender...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hah. Too easy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My hero.&quot; Akari comments from the sidelines. &quot;Good job defeating that wicked woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... I&#x27;m not wicked... Just misunderstood...&quot;</p>
<p>Akari chuckles before a yawn escapes her mouth. It spreads like an infectious disease, first to Marley and finally to me on top of Marley.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s getting late.&quot; She gets up from her bed to collect her pillow from the ground. </p>
<p>Marly managed to lose it within the first 10 seconds of battle. Rookie mistake. Don&#x27;t throw away your only weapon.</p>
<p>&quot;You should go to your room and sleep, Swole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Already? The night has barely started...&quot; She lets out a long, gloomy sigh. &quot;He can sleep in my bed... If he wants to... I don&#x27;t snore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you do, <em>Zoey</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Just a little... And I&#x27;m not a Zoey...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m on Marley&#x27;s side on this issue. Can&#x27;t I convince you to let me sleep in your room, my dearest fiancée?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not. It&#x27;s improper. My mother would haunt me if I allowed a man to share my bed before we were wed. Besides, Typhlosion doesn&#x27;t like sharing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lopunny doesn&#x27;t like sharing either-- Yaaawn.&quot; Feel like lead is pulling my eyelids closed. &quot;Good grief. You win, Akari. For now. See you tomorrow, girls. Goodnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight, dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Night-night...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Goth-Goth.&quot;</p>
<p>Heh. Cute.</p>
