<p><strong>Narrator-POV:</strong></p>
<p>Thus, the evening has found its end. </p>
<p>The final night of their week-long survival lesson has passed. </p>
<p>And their final morning of the next day begins with the sounds of professor Hedera&#x27;s off-road truck.</p>
<p>She came early to pick up the group and has kindly explained that their classmate Paul has been safely recovered from the wilderness.</p>
<p>He did not manage to pass the survival lesson and will be held back for the 4th week of trainer school.</p>
<p>Dawn&#x27;s secretly held fears of failing trainer school, have also been assuaged when professor Hedera informed them that they have all passed.</p>
<p>Swole and Akari, with flying colors, and Dawn managed to convince the combat instructor with her displayed growth and progress as a trainer.</p>
<p>Dawn was relieved beyond measure, until realization hit her that her bikini was filmed by drones and seen by her teachers. Relief quickly made way for embarrassment for the rest of the ride.</p>
<p>The professor&#x27;s parting words, just before they reached the mass of other waiting students, were: </p>
<p>&quot;I would recommend not eating any pokemon in public. It is certainly legal, but almost everyone in every city would frown upon you for doing it. Being known as a pokemon-eater is not a label you want to stain your career with.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you guys it was gross!&quot; Lucas felt vindicated at her statement.</p>
<p>However, the professor did not intend to discourage the trainers. &quot;Don&#x27;t listen to him. It&#x27;s healthy, it&#x27;s natural, sometimes you don&#x27;t have an alternative and many rural areas still do it culturally. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, and you will have a hard time finding a professor, champion, breeder or top coordinator over the age of 30 who hasn&#x27;t eaten pokemon at least once.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor, despite looking rather young and fit, was already 36 years old and had worked with many now famous colleagues, who did partake in the borderline cruel activities.</p>
<p>She herself has eaten a lot of pokemon during her studies of the wilderness zones.</p>
<p>As for the reason for the disconnect of regular people to the realities of the pokemon world: It is because they see them as pets nowadays. </p>
<p>Dogs, cats and other domesticated pet-animals have been consistently replaced with pokemon.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the fact that these pets often have human-level intelligence.</p>
<p>Magikarp are actually as intelligent as a small child.</p>
<p>The unwashed masses consider eating pokemon as repulsive as eating a human. Many regions have abolished the tradition entirely, because of this.</p>
<p>All regions, except for Kanto, Johto and Sinnoh. </p>
<p>These three regions have made the authoritarian decision to stay with their traditions and keep a list of rapidly multiplying pokemon instead. </p>
<p>They are the pokemon who are generally preyed upon by other pokemon in nature and are legal to be hunted and eaten by humans.</p>
<p>Once the students have met up with everyone else, the greater group of Swole, Dawn, Lucas, Akari, Barry and Zoey seat themselves in the back of the bus to tell each other of their week for the duration of the ride.</p>
<p>Zoey has captured a Glameow she found over the week and Barry captured the first pokemon they stumbled upon. </p>
<p>A Starly.</p>
<p>Later, Barry has also captured a Buizel as his third pokemon.</p>
<p>Akari did not find a pokemon that she considered suitable for her team and ended up with no new addition. </p>
<p>But she is certainly not falling behind, since her Cyndaquil alone can still beat Barry&#x27;s entire team in a friendly match.</p>
<p>Akari was also the de facto captain of their little team, due to her survival knowledge. </p>
<p>Over the week, she has taught Zoey and Barry how to navigate forests, how to find wild berry trees and generally, how to survive.</p>
<p>And she has managed to convince Zoey to eat pokemon with her too.</p>
<p>The two girls had agreed to keep it a secret at first but realized that their counterparts, Swole and Dawn, had done the same thing, when Lucas and Barry started gossiping about their &#x27;gross and disgusting&#x27; teammates.</p>
<p>Overall, the students decided that it was a fun, useful and memorable week.</p>
<p>Once back in Jubilife City, life returned to normal.</p>
<p>Going to class, visiting the remaining sights and cooking, training and studying together.</p>
<p>One of the last sights remaining was the global trade station, commonly abbreviated to GTS. They went there in the hopes of shopping for rare pokemon items.</p>
<p>Things like evolution stones, technical machines (TMs), power boosters and elusive mega stones.</p>
<p>Although the GTS had almost everything to offer, anything it did offer, was at exorbitant prices. Far out of the price-range of badge-less students.</p>
<p>And so the days passed.</p>
<p>Everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>Everything, except for Akari.</p>
<p>Swole has noticed that she is increasingly distant and behaving more and more nervously for some reason. </p>
<p>Especially around Lucas.</p>
<p>The girls try to include her in their activities, but she keeps giving flimsy excuses and only participates in events with the whole group.</p>
<p>As for the other girls; Zoey and Dawn have invested some time to catch up with the most important events of the Grand Festival that concluded while they were away.</p>
<p>The winner turned out to be Fantina, the Hearthome City gym leader and a world famous ghost pokemon trainer.</p>
<p>Her final battle, or rather show, was decided by her Banette and Drifblim in an all-new, never-seen-before performance. </p>
<p>Drifblim shrouded the stage in complete darkness and Banette had used flashy attacks in elaborate patterns to tell a short, visual story, while defeating their opponents at the same time.</p>
<p>She won by judge points as well as by defeating her opponents who could not manage to defog the arena.</p>
<p>By the time her opponent&#x27;s pokemon were defeated, they did not manage to accrue enough style points to secure a win.</p>
<p>As for this year&#x27;s league conference, of the almost 100 trainers who managed to collect all 8 badges, all but 64 were sorted out during the preliminary fights.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 64 remaining trainers were pitted against each other using non-random match ups: </p>
<p>The trainers who were estimated to be the 32 strongest, had to fight the weakest trainers.</p>
<p>So number 1, Cynthia, fought against number 64, an unrecognized trainer by the name of Sergio, from Kanto. While number 32 fought number 33.</p>
<p>This is done to ensure that the strongest fighters do not accidentally knock each other out on the first day and ruin the whole event. As well as create more exciting matches for the more average trainers.</p>
<p>Some might say this is to the detriment of the weakest trainers, but they had no chance to win either way.</p>
<p>Monday through Wednesday, this repeated. </p>
<p>But Thursday, the 8 strongest trainers of the Sinnoh region are all considered to be on almost the same level of strength and their match ups are randomized instead.</p>
<p>Today, on Friday, the 4 semi-finalists are going to be fighting.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>I got dressed in my gym uniform today.</p>
<p>Slick, black suit pants with matching shoes. </p>
<p>An ironed, white dress shirt, with rolled back sleeves. The uppermost button, left unclasped to show off the beginnings of my muscles and my very first bit chest hair.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> <em>Note, that it is a single, blonde hair. It is not even visible against his pale skin.</em></p>
<p>And my belt with two pokeballs.</p>
<p>I also made sure my hair looks both well maintained and a little wild at the same time.</p>
<p>My style is on fleek.</p>
<p>&quot;Who do you think will win today?&quot; Asks Barry as I move my hand through my hair again, to make sure it&#x27;s still perfect.</p>
<p>Right now we are preparing a light breakfast together, before the class tournament.</p>
<p>&quot;I really hope Candice wins!&quot; Says Zoey. </p>
<p>She is sitting on a chair and chatting with Dawn while we fry up some eggs for breakfast sandwiches.</p>
<p>Candice is this year&#x27;s underdog. </p>
<p>She had a lucky few rounds and got good match ups. She is an ice-monotype trainer from Snowpoint City. And this is her third attempt in the Platinum League conference.</p>
<p>Commentators are saying she might inherit the Snowpoint City gym this year, and it&#x27;s no surprise that Zoey wants a fellow Snowpoint City dweller to win this year.</p>
<p>But her team doesn&#x27;t stand a chance against Cynthia. &quot;Cynthia will easily get into the finals again. And between the other 3... I think that Johto guy has really good chances.&quot;</p>
<p>The semi-finalists are Cynthia Shirona, defending her champion title, Candice Kiai, Volkner Pearl, an uncle of Barry and... Tobias Ryushu. </p>
<p>&quot;You mean Tobias? I don&#x27;t think he stands a chance against Candice. His dragons can&#x27;t do shit against her ice team.&quot; Argues Lucas.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t count him out just yet. Lance won against Lorelei too and I think that Lance <em>Ryushu</em> taught this guy how to win against ice trainers. Besides, it&#x27;s randomized.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yea, but he only has 5 pokemon!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That just means his 5 pokemon have got to be a whole lot tougher than usual. And he didn&#x27;t even have to show his 5th pokemon yet! He won all his battles with just 4 pokemon! I swear, that guy is tough.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wanna bet?&quot; Asks Lucas.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys. Don&#x27;t do betting.&quot; Dawn tries to reel us back in.</p>
<p>Betting is for suckers. &quot;She&#x27;s right. Have you forgotten the prices at the GTS? We can&#x27;t waste our money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, alright. I guess you are too pussy, to stand by your opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you. I&#x27;ll see you in the tournament. Try not to drop out in the first round.&quot; </p>
<p>I say as I pick up two sandwiches and leave first with Buneary grinning evilly at Lucas.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome everybody!&quot; The combat instructor shouts out to us from the arena. &quot;For those of you who have forgotten or see me for the first time, my name is Captain Braviary! And my powers stem from my belief in Mew!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What powers!?&quot; Someone shouts.</p>
<p>Captain Braviary ignores the random comment from the bleachers. &quot;I have taken the time and looked over your performance over the previous weekend. Based on that, I have matched up the tournament... like this!&quot;</p>
<p>He whooshes an arm around and out of nowhere a rolled up, large piece of paper unrolls and unveils the tournament brackets. </p>
<p>His Chansey stands next to it and starts panicking a little bit.</p>
<p>A 16 participants tournament with 4 guests, since there are only 12 students.</p>
<p>A couple of camera flashes light up. The Jubilife TV, a multi-media company that does not specialize on TV only, is also in attendance today. </p>
<p>They are here because students of our school have an incredibly high success rate.</p>
<p>I heard that of the graduates, 80% become successful trainers in their respective fields. 20% even become internationally recognized. </p>
<p>Like Cynthia, professor Rowan and Barry&#x27;s father: Palmer Pearl.</p>
<p>The important families are paying a fortune into the success of their children and then, predictably, the children succeed.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s nepotism.</p>
<p>But it works and I benefit from it. So, who cares.</p>
<p>&quot;What!?&quot; The instructor suddenly exclaims. &quot;How in the hells did that happen?!&quot; </p>
<p>A few names on the paper are unreadable because the ink was smudged.</p>
<p>He shouldn&#x27;t have rolled up the paper.</p>
<p>But from what I can see it is me versus &#x27;Guest 1&#x27;. </p>
<p>Lucas versus a smudge. </p>
<p>Zoey and Dawn are up for a rematch and Akari and Barry are set up for an incredibly unbalanced fight.</p>
<p>Then, there are a few more matches between smudges and guests and one smudge that looks a lot like a peach pit. </p>
<p>Seriously. It has the two semi-circles on each side and a weird black starfish-like spot in the middle.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a little weird how only our names are readable. </p>
<p>But that&#x27;s just one of those weird coincidences of the universe.</p>
<p>Like, how the moon is 400 times smaller than the sun, and coincidentally, the distance from our planet to the sun, is 400 times greater than the distance between the moon and our planet. Which makes them both appear the same size.</p>
<p>Anyway, Buneary and I are the first to battle and once Captain Braviary calls for us, we make our way down and eye our opponent.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s about 8 years old. At most. </p>
<p>And he wears blue shorts, a tank top, a hat and carries a bug catching net.</p>
<p>... He is a bug catcher.</p>
<p>Buneary hops to her spot on the battlefield and starts growling at him.</p>
<p>&quot;You need to call out your pokemon for the fight.&quot; Captain Braviary reminds the young child.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Right... Metapod, come on out!&quot;</p>
<p>... A Metapod...</p>
<p>Seriously? </p>
<p>Did we not manage to get any better guest trainers? </p>
<p>The Metapod is literally shaking in fear.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; - &quot;We surrender!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Boy! Why did you sign up only to surrender immediately?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That Buneary is too scary! Metapod, return!&quot; The kid almost starts crying and the combat instructor face-palms and sighs heavily.</p>
<p>I think I need to verify Buneary&#x27;s ability.</p>
<p>It should be Limber but at this point I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if she actually has Intimidate.</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. Well, a win is a win. Come on Buneary, let&#x27;s go watch Lucas lose in the first round.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel bad about this fight. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s more like bullying a little child.</p>
<p>But Buneary looks proud as a lion as she prances back to me. </p>
<p>Winning without even fighting was a massive ego-boost to her, rather than a hit to her guilty conscience.</p>
<p>Does she have a guilty conscience?</p>
<p>&quot;Right!&quot; The combat instructor removes his hand from his face and turns to the audience. &quot;Swole Solo and Buneary are the winners! You two may return to your seats.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Next up! Lucas Diamond and... uhhh...&quot; </p>
<p>He struggles to read the splotch of ink on the tournament overview. </p>
<p>&quot;You! Fisherman guy! Come down here!&quot;</p>
<p>Oh! It&#x27;s that guy again. </p>
<p>He wears a different fisherman outfit now but I know he has a Tynamo. </p>
<p>Today he comes in a dark red swimming vest and his fishing rod has a super ball bobber design.</p>
<p>As he passes by me on his way down to the arena, he gives me a nod in greeting and I nod back.</p>
<p>He seems like a decent bloke.</p>
<p>I really hope he wins now. </p>
<p>Lucas would be so pissed.</p>
<p>The two hold out the pokeballs they want to use for the fight. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s an unofficial rule, that participants of a fight do not change the first pokemon they want to start battle with after they see what their opponent uses.</p>
<p>Except in league organized fights. </p>
<p>In that case, your team order is registered and it becomes an official rule to use the registered first pokemon.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on out Chimchar! We&#x27;re in it to win it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s flex our mussels! Shellder, come out!&quot; Chimchar and Shellder emerge from their pokeballs and Shellder strikes a pose where he balances on two of his horns as if they were legs.</p>
<p>What a catchphrase! That guy is amazing!</p>
<p>&quot;Are you both ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; - &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas is as lax as ever. Even though he is at a clear type disadvantage. </p>
<p>His confidence, or rather cockiness, is bordering on... Well... Bordering on being overconfident. Not sure if there is a better word it could be bordering on.</p>
<p>Never mind the borders, if the Tynamo guy has improved at a similar rate as Lucas did, then Lucas doesn&#x27;t stand a chance.</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Withdraw! / Flame Wheel!&quot;</p>
<p>Chimchar encases himself in a mantle of fire and spins towards Shellder, who simply closes his shell and a thin layer of water envelops him. </p>
<p>Somehow the water solidifies and takes the brunt of the Flame Wheel as the two pokemon clash in close combat.</p>
<p>I have never seen Withdraw before but intuitively, I would say this move is the perfect counter to every fire attack. </p>
<p>It looks as if Chimchar can&#x27;t even apply the burn status effect to his opponent anymore.</p>
<p>The Flame Wheel probably did close to 0 damage here and was turned entirely into a gap-closer by Shellder&#x27;s defenses.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t let up! Power-Up Punch!&quot; - &quot;Again, With-- No, change to our offensive plan!&quot;</p>
<p>Shellder retreats a little back into his shell, preventing outside viewers from seeing what he is preparing while Chimchar&#x27;s fighting type attack hits the shell for some minimal damage.</p>
<p>Power-Up Punch is an attacking move which is not used entirely for the damage, but for the power increasing properties of the move. </p>
<p>Chimchar&#x27;s muscles visibly bulge and tighten and his raw attacking power increases.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, a massive flood of water spills out of Shellder&#x27;s mouth-hole. And then he spins in place to give the whole thing a spin.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s Whirlpool!</p>
<p>And Chimchar is at the worst possible place to be caught in the move.</p>
<p>He is spinning right around Shellder close to the center.</p>
<p>The water swells and takes up about a quarter of the arena but magically remains in the shape of a funnel. </p>
<p>The sides are around a meter in the air and the spinning water drags everything close towards the center, where Shellder is still spinning around.</p>
<p>And unlike regular water, this water is infused with type energy and it&#x27;s going to hurt Chimchar for as long as he stays in there.</p>
<p>&quot;Blast yourself out of there with Ember!&quot;</p>
<p>He&#x27;s struggling for a little while but eventually manages to rip a hole onto the Whirlpool with his Ember where Chimchar falls out of the attack. </p>
<p>The centrifugal force, or rather the momentum, still tosses him halfway across the arena and away from Shellder.</p>
<p>He looks in bad shape.</p>
<p>&quot;Water Gun! Let&#x27;s keep the initiative!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dodge and then another Power-Up Punch!&quot;</p>
<p>The whirlpool falls to the ground, washes over the arena once but then quickly dissipates.</p>
<p>The fatigue is starting to show in Shellder. </p>
<p>He&#x27;s taking really long to charge up his Water Gun now and Chimchar manages to easily dodge it while he closes the distance.</p>
<p>Next, Chimchar sprints the rest of the distance and hits yet another Power-Up Punch which further increases his strength.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow up with Scratch and then Fury Swipes!&quot; - &quot;Retreat into Withdraw!&quot;</p>
<p>The Scratch hits the target before Shellder could complete his Withdraw and then... </p>
<p>I lean forward.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>Chimchar somehow managed to immediately use Fury Swipes right after Scratch. </p>
<p>Last time I saw Chimchar use Fury Swipes, he took forever to charge it. </p>
<p>Now he can do it much faster than it should be possible!</p>
<p>&quot;Buneary, did you get that?&quot; I ask her and she nods.</p>
<p>I know that Pokemon have much better senses. Including a vague sense for compatible energies. </p>
<p>I will need to discuss that further with Buneary when we have the time.</p>
<p>We need to be able to do this too. At the very least I need to expect others to do this against us.</p>
<p>At the same time as Fury Swipes ends, Withdraw finishes too.</p>
<p>&quot;Another Power-Up Punch!&quot; - &quot;Push him away with Whirlpool!&quot;</p>
<p>This time the water type move stutters and stalls because Shellder just can&#x27;t collect any more type energy. </p>
<p>He has overused the water type with no breaks, and this will be the end of the match.</p>
<p>Power-Up Punch hits again but Chimchar&#x27;s muscles do not bulge a 3rd time. 2 times is the limit for him right now.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit! Use Ice Shard instead!&quot; - &quot;Counter with Scratch and Fury Swipes!&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, the fisherman remembers to switch his attack types and almost instantly a thin spike of ice shoots out of Shellder&#x27;s mouth.</p>
<p>It was too fast to be countered by Chimchar.</p>
<p>Chimchar stumbles back from getting a face full of ice but he pulls himself back together and continues his Scratch and Fury Swipes combo through the pain.</p>
<p>This time, at the end of the Fury Swipes, Shellder passes out. </p>
<p>The two halves of his shell open up fully, his tongue lolls out and his eyes turn into swirls.</p>
<p>&quot;Shellder is KO! Chimchar and Lucas Diamond are the winners! Congratulations to you two. And good effort you too...&quot; Captain Braviary rechecks the tournament board, still showing the blotch instead of a name. </p>
<p>&quot;... <em>You</em> did well. No need to fuss over a loss. Continue to improve like you did, and you will become a great trainer.&quot;</p>
<p>Captain Braviary pats the fisherman on the shoulder before sending him on his way to get his pokemon healed by Chansey.</p>
<p>&quot;Would Zoey Evans and Dawn Berlitz please enter the arena?&quot; He shouts out before making his way to the tournament board and writes my and Lucas names into the next round of the elimination battles.</p>
<p>&quot;Good luck you two.&quot; I tell them before they walk down the stairs and onto the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks / Thanks.&quot; They both say at the same time before glaring at each other.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>The two ladies walk down the stairs, side by side, each trying to look dignified and confident.</p>
<p>Dawn has pulled out a different set of clothes today. </p>
<p>Short blue boots and a dark blue turtle-neck pullover with golden accents on it. In addition to a light-pink skirt.</p>
<p>Zoey goes for her tomboy look. Jeans with a pullover tied around her waist, a white and tight t-shirt over her torso and her aviators stuck in her hair.</p>
<p>Both look good. </p>
<p>And confident.</p>
<p>But I know Dawn&#x27;s usual nervous ticks. Usually she fidgets with her hands. </p>
<p>Either messing around with her hair or tapping her thumb to the side of her index finger.</p>
<p>And when she can&#x27;t do that, she pulls them into tight fists. Like she does right now.</p>
<p>And I know for a fact that she is not actually confident in her chances against Zoey. </p>
<p>I remember, back in the forest, she told me she was going to easily defeat her rival with all the progress that we made together. But over the week, she saw that Zoey didn&#x27;t go slacking off either.</p>
<p>They have both improved tremendously and I think Dawn&#x27;s confidence in her chances took a hit when she realized that.</p>
<p>Zoey is probably also just pretending. I think. </p>
<p>When she saw Piplup&#x27;s and Dawn&#x27;s performance during training, she had asked me what Dawn did to improve so much in such a short time. </p>
<p>She seemed really worried at the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Piplup, let&#x27;s splash the competition!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s time to enchant the audience! Let&#x27;s go Misdreavus!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary and I need a decent catchphrase for our battles.</p>
<p>I was not aware that I needed one for the tournament. </p>
<p>Should I just go with &#x27;don&#x27;t kill them&#x27;? It fits our theme.</p>
<p>When Piplup comes out of the pokeball, a bunch of bubbles come out with him that shoot out in random directions over the arena. </p>
<p>He also strikes a pose with his flippers stretched out. &quot;Piplup!&quot;</p>
<p>And for Misdreavus, when her ball releases her, a large, dark smoke cloud comes out with her that obscures her and only lets her shadow be visible.</p>
<p>Misdreavus&#x27; shadow dissolves, as if watching a mirage clear itself and when the smoke cloud dissipates completely, Misdreavus is gone!</p>
<p>&quot;Hihi&quot; </p>
<p>A girlish laugh comes from the arena.</p>
<p>A suspiciously shaped shadow moves across the field.</p>
<p>Out of it emerges Misdreavus with a little twirl.</p>
<p>In terms of spectacle, Zoey won this.</p>
<p>That was unironically pretty cool to look at.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have gotten a few of these pokeball stickers after all. </p>
<p>The girls tried to convince us guys to get some but none of us took the bait at that time. Perhaps I should...</p>
<p>... Nah.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahem! Are you two ready? Or do you wish for some more time to show off?&quot; The combat instructor asks. </p>
<p>Sarcastically? </p>
<p>There was no tonal hint for it to be sarcastic. He sounded serious about the offer.</p>
<p>But the fighters decline the extra time and give their ready signals.</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bubble Beam!&quot; - &quot;Thunder Wave!&quot;</p>
<p>Both pokemon seem to have readied themselves before the fight began, and instantly released their pre-planned attacks.</p>
<p>A wave of lightning washes across the battlefield, charging sand and small rocks with static electricity wherever the wave meets the ground.</p>
<p>On the other side, Piplup releases a tight beam of bubbles. A few of them have a downward spin and they plop into the ground!</p>
<p>Dawn took a page out of Akari&#x27;s book and is creating a cloud of dust over the battlefield.</p>
<p>But unlike Akari, she didn&#x27;t have to waste most of the attack&#x27;s power to create the cloud. </p>
<p>The vast majority of bubbles keep shooting straight and hit their mark right against Misdreavus!</p>
<p>Piplup&#x27;s control over the bubbles is impressive. </p>
<p>And the Thunder Wave from a non-electric pokemon is too weak to pass through the little bit of dust and mud in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Confusion! Knock him in the air!&quot; - &quot;Roll away!&quot;</p>
<p>But the move comes out too quickly and manages to catch Piplup mid-roll. Dealing some damage and knocking him into the air in an arc.</p>
<p>&quot;Follow up with a Confuse Ray!&quot; - &quot;Piplup, use Bubble Beam against Misdreavus!&quot;</p>
<p>Three small projectiles that spin around each other float swiftly across the battlefield and are aimed at Piplup&#x27;s landing spot.</p>
<p>Mid-air, Piplup uses Bubble Beam again and it moves him slightly off course... </p>
<p>... I don&#x27;t think Dawn thought that through fully.</p>
<p>The bubbles pass through the Confuse Ray without them interacting with each other. </p>
<p>Piplup&#x27;s attack pushes him further away from Misdreavus but eventually, the Confuse Ray still hits Piplup.</p>
<p>The knock-back effect of the Bubble Beam only increased the distance the Confuse Ray had to move! </p>
<p>Dawn should have used Bubble Beam to either side instead and by the way Dawn facepalms, I can tell she also realizes her blunder.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on Piplup! Snap out of it! Use Aerial Ace!&quot;</p>
<p>Uwah? As far as I know, Piplup still can&#x27;t really use Aerial Ace! Last time I checked, he still failed 4 out of 5 times.</p>
<p>&quot;Misdreavus use Swift!&quot;</p>
<p>Piplup&#x27;s flying type energy collects but then suddenly dissipates uselessly. The move failed... </p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>Now I get it! The move failed and no energy could rebound and Piplup did not hurt himself in his confused state!</p>
<p>And if it DID succeed, there would have been a chance for the move to work despite the confusion!</p>
<p>Although, the confusion probably made the move much less likely to succeed, so I doubt the effectiveness of the strategy. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s worth looking further into it though.</p>
<p>Misdreavus on the other hand was free to hit Swift without issues. </p>
<p>Perfect aim against a stationary target.</p>
<p>&quot;Confusion, again. Knock him around a little.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn mumbles something that sounded like a curse. &quot;... Use Bubble Beam!&quot;</p>
<p>This time Bubble Beam charges up but the bubbles are flying all over the place, some hitting Piplup and none crossing the large distance to hit Misdreavus.</p>
<p>The Confusion then makes it even worse because Piplup is knocked around and hits even more bubbles.</p>
<p>Piplup lands on his face, stumbles up and around for a few steps but then his eyes turn into swirls and he falls over, face first.</p>
<p>&quot;Piplup is KO! Misdreavus and Zoey are the winners!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shit...&quot; This time Dawn audibly curses as she returns Piplup to his pokeball where he can rest. &quot;Sigh, good job Piplup. You did your best. Next time we will win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Woho! Good job Misdreavus!&quot; Misdreavus flies into a tight hug with her trainer and they spin around and cheer.</p>
<p>&quot;You two can leave. Chansey is waiting near the stairs to heal your pokemon.&quot; Captain Braviary directs the trainers off the stage and the two are followed with some camera flashes. </p>
<p>&quot;Next! Would Akari Platinum and Barry Pearl come to the arena?&quot;</p>
<p>I can see Dawn and Zoey talking a little on the way before hugging each other while Dawn has some tears in her eye.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Good luck, Akari.&quot; I wish her good luck as she and Barry pass me on their way down.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t lose too hard, Barry.&quot; Says Lucas.</p>
<p>Akari smiles in response and I can&#x27;t help but grin at Barry as he grumbles about the unfair treatment just because he is a guy.</p>
<p>Even though Lucas was simply right this time. </p>
<p>This time, it has nothing to do with Barry being a dude.</p>
<p>Akari is just too strong with her Cyndaquil. She probably has trained her for years already. </p>
<p>Like that Ash guy, whose Pikachu knows tricks that we can only dream of.</p>
<p>&quot;Go, Cyndaquil.&quot; - &quot;Let&#x27;s win this! Buizel!&quot;</p>
<p>Cyndaquil hops down from Akari&#x27;s shoulder and into position and Barry tosses his pokeball from which a regular looking Buizel emerges.</p>
<p>I saw his performance during training a few times and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m too impressed. </p>
<p>He&#x27;s a little stronger than a regular wild pokemon, but that is probably just due to the training he had since he was captured.</p>
<p>Cyndaquil is at a type disadvantage but I doubt that is going to matter against their skill.</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quick Attack!&quot; - &quot;Switch to plan B.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh shit!</p>
<p>Cyndaquil charges some fire type energy but interrupts herself shortly before being hit.</p>
<p>The Quick Attack hits right on target and Cyndaquil takes some damage as she tanks the move.</p>
<p>&quot;Cyn!&quot; 3 balls of purple glowing fire float out of Cyndaquil&#x27;s back and slowly move to converge upon Buizel.</p>
<p>Will-O-Wisp.</p>
<p>The water pokemon, usually easily able to counter any fire move, is still recovering from using his own attack and cannot dodge. </p>
<p>The Will-O-Wisp fire blazes up for a short moment before seeping into a single spot on Buizel. </p>
<p>There, it leaves a discolored spot on the surface. </p>
<p>A burn mark.</p>
<p>Buizel is in a really bad spot already. </p>
<p>Not only will the burn continuously damage him, but it also lowers his attacking power!</p>
<p>&quot;Use Water Gun!&quot;</p>
<p>Cyndaquil is still continuing with her plan and tanks another attack, this time a very effective water move.</p>
<p>After tanking, and charging her next attack, she suddenly catches fire, her whole body burning brightly, and jumps against her target. </p>
<p>Buizel is only hurt a little bit by the non-effective attack, but then, somehow, the flames move back towards Cyndaquil, whose dorsal fire starts burning more brightly.</p>
<p>I have no idea what move that was, but it seems to have some strategic advantage.</p>
<p>Still without another command, Cyndaquil uses Quick Attack to get to the other side of the battle, away from Buizel.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t let her escape! Follow her with Quick Attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Buizel charges after her but Cyndaquil just dodge-rolls to the side causing Buizel to overshoot his target.</p>
<p>&quot;Go back to plan A!&quot; Akari shouts across the arena to make sure her pokemon hears the change of plans.</p>
<p>Almost instantly afterwards, Cyndaquil releases a Smokescreen all around herself.</p>
<p>Is plan A to use the weird Curse?</p>
<p>&quot;Flush her out with Water Gun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Plan B again!&quot;</p>
<p>The Water Gun shoots blindly into the Smokescreen, moving left to right and back to the left, desperately trying to hit Cyndaquil.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a steaming, hot Cyndaquil jumps out of the smoke cloud, encased in flames and rams into Buizel again.</p>
<p>The hit was still weak but still manages to drop Buizel to one knee.</p>
<p>Yet again, the flames seep back into Cyndaquil&#x27;s body and increase the blaze on her back into a tiny inferno.</p>
<p>Is that Flame Charge? </p>
<p>If so, how did she manage to hide it from us during training? </p>
<p>Is that why she was being so seclusive? For secret training?</p>
<p>As for her strategies, I think plan A is to hide and wait for the win, while plan B might be to run away and wait for the win.</p>
<p>&quot;Point blank, Quick Attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Buizel runs towards Cyndaquil but she is so quick now, that she can dodge the move despite the close range. </p>
<p>At the end of Buizel&#x27;s sprint he falls over in pain but gets up again.</p>
<p>The continuous damage is taking its toll.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it! Buizel, use Water Gun again but spread out the attack!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He stole that from me...&quot; Grumbles out Dawn next to me.</p>
<p>Good choice, Cyndaquil can already dodge Quick Attack without a lot of reaction time, something unavoidable is his best chance now.</p>
<p>&quot;Counter with Swift!&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of running away uselessly, this time Cyndaquil shoots out a shower of tiny stars that blast a hole through the wall of Water Gun. Some projectiles even went through completely and hit Buizel.</p>
<p>A couple more stars sneak through and then the low pressure wall of water stops completely.</p>
<p>&quot;Buizel is KO! Akari Platinum and her Cyndaquil win!&quot;</p>
<p>Another barrage of camera flashes lights up the battlefield as the two trainers take their pokemon and walk towards the Chansey near the stairs.</p>
<p>Barry is crestfallen again but brightens up after Akari says something to him that I couldn&#x27;t hear.</p>
<p>Honestly, Barry did a lot better than I thought he would. </p>
<p>His only real blunder was the first Quick Attack. </p>
<p>Or rather, he probably didn&#x27;t yet know a retaliation like that was possible.</p>
<p>That was the same kind of unfair shit that this Pikachu did.</p>
<p>... My next battle is against Lucas, then Akari and then either a guest or a blotch of ink. </p>
<p>Or I lose against Akari.</p>
<p>The next four battles are guests and splotches and I only need to watch their semi-final battle.</p>
<p>I pick up Buneary and stand up with her. We need to go strategize in peace.</p>
<p>It would be nice to watch Asshole lose, but it might as well demoralize me if he wins.</p>
<p>Not watching them is the right choice.</p>
<p>&quot;See ya later.&quot; I say goodbye to Dawn, Zoey and Lucas before I go down the stairs.</p>
<p>Akari is right down the stairs together with Barry and Chansey. Chansey is currently healing Buizel and Akari is waiting for her turn. </p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations Akari. Your battle skills are incredible.&quot;</p>
<p>She startles and then turns around. &quot;Thank you, Swole. I admire your battle skills as well. You won your fight without giving out a single order or even making a single move.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;That was a joke. But 2 weeks ago, you showed great skill. Today your opponent was just very weak.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Oh! It was a very good joke!&quot; </p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t. The delivery was flat and far too formal. </p>
<p>Who taught her how to make jokes? Dawn&#x27;s great great great great great grandmother? </p>
<p>&quot;Haha, yea... Poor kid. I felt a little bad for him in the end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, where are you going? I believe it will be some time before your next bout?&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;Bout&#x27; means battle? &quot;I&#x27;m looking for a secluded spot to strategize a little. I want to maximize my chances against Lucas. And if I want to have a winning chance against you after that, then I need all the strategy I can get.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha! I know you will do well in your fights. And I know you are a great trainer! And once we cross paths on our way to the finale, then... Then I will need to give it my all and I wish you good fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. And good luck in your fight against Zoey too... Well, see ya later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Until soon.&quot; </p>
<p>&#x27;Until soon&#x27;? Sometimes she talks really weirdly. </p>
<p>If she wasn&#x27;t so cute, I would probably put her into the same mental box as the other weirdo&#x27;s I met recently.</p>
<p>Anyway, with Buneary on my shoulder, I select a lonely place on the bleachers. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s on the opposite end of Asshole&#x27;s loner-spot and then I start strategizing together with Buneary.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;So.&quot; I pull out my notebook.</p>
<p>&quot;Bune?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You said you understood what Lucas and Chimchar did with Scratch and Fury Swipes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bun. Buneary Bune.&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing. Damn.</p>
<p>This weird ability would have been really useful right now.</p>
<p>I guess I&#x27;ve been trying too hard to understand her, for this weird subconscious thing to happen again.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s start by writing down what I can remember.</p>
<p>Basically, Chimchar used Scratch and then without charging again, he switched into Fury Swipes.</p>
<p>According to the pokedex, Scratch is not an incredible move.</p>
<p>It has no extra effect and it simply has an output of 40 type power, or TP, in professor Kukui&#x27;s model.</p>
<p>Fury Swipes is pretty much the same move, except it&#x27;s much weaker but it hits an average of 2.8 times instead.</p>
<p>Fury Swipes is rated at 18TP. So that&#x27;s... 50 point-something in total.</p>
<p>The only difference between that and... let&#x27;s say Quick Attack with Pound is the base strength.</p>
<p>... The total power is somewhat similar too.</p>
<p>... I get it!</p>
<p>We tried Quick Attack into Double Kick as well as Quick Attack into Pound!</p>
<p>When chaining these moves together, Pound comes out quicker than a chain with Double Kick.</p>
<p>But on its own, Pound takes about as much time as Double Kick.</p>
<p>Buneary must be gathering more power than needed and can then reuse that energy for the next attack.</p>
<p>And the reason why Fury Swipes was so much quicker, is because a single hit is just so much weaker.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you use leftover energy from one attack to charge the next one?&quot; I ask Buneary a simple yes or no question for her to verify my theory.</p>
<p>&quot;Bun!&quot; Yes! Alright! Hole in one!</p>
<p>&quot;In that case... Would you be able to use Double Kick instantly after Jump Kick?&quot;</p>
<p>After a short moment of consideration, &quot;Bun.&quot;</p>
<p>Awesome! Sweet! That would be a pretty insane combo attack!</p>
<p>&quot;This means that Jump Kick and then Pound would take longer because they are two different types, right?&quot;</p>
<p>This time Buneary thinks a little longer, &quot;Bun.&quot;</p>
<p>And since we learned to reliably use Double Hit, we can replace Pound with it completely.</p>
<p>Double Hit&#x27;s individual strikes are rated as a little bit weaker than Pound, so the move should come out faster after a Quick Attack.</p>
<p>I wish I could speak with Buneary properly!</p>
<p>Just how many pro-tips does she have stored away in that cute little head of hers?</p>
<p>&quot;Next up,&quot; I leaf to the next page on my notepad. &quot;Piplup used a move that would most likely fail when he was confused. Does that make sense to you or would waiting out the confusion be better? ... Can I get a yes or a no on Dawn being smart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bunnie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So Dawn&#x27;s move was kinda dumb?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; I cross out my notes and go to the next page.</p>
<p>&quot;Then let&#x27;s think of some strats... For Lucas I would say we just start the fight with Baby-Doll Eyes and then beat his pokemon up with superior strength. This should work equally well for Chimchar as well as for Buizel.&quot;</p>
<p>She nods along energetically, her ears flopping around.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides a random burn effect, there isn&#x27;t anything that Lucas can do against us... No, wait.&quot;</p>
<p>I mentally go through his last battle again. &quot;Actually, Power-Up Punch could be a major issue and we need to dodge it. If we had Play Rough, then we could counter it but as it is, dodging is the only option.&quot;</p>
<p>Now she nods along in a disappointed manner.</p>
<p>I know she loves brawling and hates being weaker in any kind of way.</p>
<p>&quot;Buizel has nothing. He would be a safe win. But that just means it&#x27;s safe to assume we fight against Chimchar... Let&#x27;s build up a plan A. We start off with Baby-Doll Eyes and Chimchar&#x27;s options are Flame Wheel or Ember. We can dodge Ember and break through Flame Wheel with Jump Kick.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes are starting to glaze over. I&#x27;m about to lose her already.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, Baby-Doll Eyes, dodge Ember and then use Jump Kick. Can you remember those three orders?&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes unglaze and refocus before she nods.</p>
<p>I think she can remember the orders more easily if I just skip all the explanations.</p>
<p>I look back to my notes while Buneary digests our strategy.</p>
<p>Baby-Doll Eyes is starting to become pretty bad.</p>
<p>As our opponents get stronger, the weak move will be less and less useful.</p>
<p>Our replacement for it is going to be Charm. And we have already made some progress to it, since Play Rough is just too far off.</p>
<p>I just wish we had a little more success with Charm.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s like 1 more week of training before we can use the move in battle. It would have been so much better than Baby-Doll Eyes for today.</p>
<p>&quot;After the initial exchange, I expect Lucas to enter close combat with us and then you can just destroy him with superior speed and power. The Scratch and Fury Swipes combo can be safely ignored because of their low damage output and you will dodge Power-Up Punch.&quot;</p>
<p>Plan A sounds like a solid plan.</p>
<p>&quot;If he stays at range, just continue with Baby-Doll Eyes. He can&#x27;t hit you from range. You got all that?&quot;</p>
<p>An insecure nod.</p>
<p>&quot;Baby-Doll Eyes, dodge, Jump Kick and then brawling. That&#x27;s what plan A boils down to.&quot;</p>
<p>A more confident and determined nod.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! And expect to use Double Kick right after any successful Jump Kick.&quot;</p>
<p>That will be an easy win. Maybe a Leppa Berry after the fight and we should be back in top condition for our fight against Akari.</p>
<p>... Our fight against Akari...</p>
<p>She tends to set up strategies and just wait for the win.</p>
<p>... In that case, Buneary just needs to get in and not let up. At all.</p>
<p>If Cyndaquil sets up with Will-O-Wisp, then we lose because we don&#x27;t do enough damage anymore.</p>
<p>If Cyndaquil sets up one or two Flame Charge, then we lose because she becomes too fast and we can&#x27;t hit her anymore.</p>
<p>If we lose track of Cyndaquil in her Smokescreen, then we lose because she can just hide and defeat us with her weird Curse.</p>
<p>Damn, those are some harsh loose conditions.</p>
<p>Our only way to win is to stay right on top of Cyndaquil, hit her when we can, counter Will-O-Wisp with dirt and dodge or counter any Flame Charge that comes our way.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a lot to consider. No way I can tell all that to Buneary.</p>
<p>Especially when a different battle comes up next. It would just confuse her.</p>
<p>I will just tell her the strategy after the next fight.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Swole!&quot;</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>metal bar SFX</strong></p>
<p>Oof!</p>
<p>Lucas tried to vault over the railing that separates the back rows and the front row seats but the bar fell out of the socket and he crashed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yikes. You okay dude?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ouch... Yea, I guess.&quot; He says as he shakes off the pain in the hand that he landed on.</p>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t look broken or anything. &quot;The girls sent me to pick you up. The coach gave us a lunch break before the second round will begin. He also said there will be a big announcement in 30 minutes and we should watch the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, we just got done strategizing the best way to destroy you, so we&#x27;re ready for lunch. Isn&#x27;t that right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bruh. Don&#x27;t do that to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Too late. You&#x27;re getting destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, fuck you too. By the way, did you see? One of the guests is this Ass Catchthem guy from the forest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ass Catchthem? Hahaha. Nope, I wasn&#x27;t looking at the last 4 fights. I guess he won?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yea, but it was close. He and his Pikachu seem about as tough as an opponent as Akari. But he sent out his Starly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fucking... 4 years extra experience. And then he comes with his shitty Starly? Cocky bastard. I hate Kantonians.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, come on, let&#x27;s go. The girl is waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, the girls are just talking with each other, it&#x27;s just Barry who looks like he&#x27;s waiting for us--</p>
<p>Oh! Right! &quot;Let&#x27;s not keep the girl waiting for too long.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>Lunch was a quick affair. </p>
<p>Just some brown rice, some slow-release carbs, to keep up the energy for the next few fights.</p>
<p>Lucas had returned Chimchar back to his pokeball, Chimchar still looked a little out of it from his first fight against Shellder.</p>
<p>But Buneary is still perfectly fit! Haha.</p>
<p>This is going to be a really easy fight!</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome back everybody!&quot; Captain Braviary announces after he counted 16 students and guests, who have returned to the bleachers.</p>
<p>Captain Braviary is standing by his tournament bracket paper. </p>
<p>Next to him is a strange woman with red hair and a gray, skintight outfit with a white skirt.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a few important announcements to make. First up, Team Galactic, the research and development branch of the Galaxy Acquisition Group, has graciously decided to sponsor our tournament a little bit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So the first place gets more stuff?&quot; Asks some random student from the second half of the tournament brackets.</p>
<p>A lot of heads turn in his direction. </p>
<p>All but Akari. For some reason, she seems transfixed on the woman on stage.</p>
<p>&quot;Good question!&quot; Captain Braviary shouts out and regains everyone&#x27;s attention, then he strikes a random pose where he gives us a quick salute.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, the school had originally provided the funds for a TM of the winner&#x27;s choice. This was to motivate guest trainers to give their all. But now! This prize will go to the best <strong>student</strong> in the tournament.&quot;</p>
<p>A bunch of people murmur in response to that. </p>
<p>Probably the guests who feel cheated out of their prizes.</p>
<p>&quot;But! Hear me out! But the guest trainers can still win prizes. The first place winner, no matter if a guest trainer or a student, will receive a mysterious pokemon egg. It was found inside of a ruin in the wilderness. Now, this on its own doesn&#x27;t sound very mysterious... However! ...&quot;</p>
<p>He pauses for dramatic effect, &quot;The ruin had been thoroughly researched already. No pokemon entered or exited the ruin. But all of a sudden, one morning, researchers found the egg. It appeared out of nowhere. And the researchers were unable to identify the species from the eggshell design.&quot;</p>
<p>At that, the woman removes a blanket from a stack of objects.</p>
<p>She reveals a silvery egg inside a portable incubator. There is a long, wavy and pink pattern on it. </p>
<p>There is no pokemon that comes to my mind, to identify the species of the egg.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s not all folks!&quot; The hype-beast continues his pitch as the woman reveals what&#x27;s beneath the other blanket. </p>
<p>&quot;The second place will receive the most recent item catalogue of the GTS as well as a coupon of 80.000₽. You heard that right! A cash boost to your journey of the equivalent of all 8 badges! A cash boost that most trainers don&#x27;t even manage to make in a year!&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of teenagers, and Barry, the child, in the audience stand up in excitement and the news reporters are taking photos of the revealed prizes.</p>
<p>Captain Braviary motions for the teenagers and Barry to calm down.</p>
<p>I personally don&#x27;t get why they are so hyped up. </p>
<p>Most of these people don&#x27;t have a chance to win that. </p>
<p>... Barry already fucking lost! Why did he get so hyped up?!</p>
<p>The money is a really nice reward, but the egg has the potential to be even better. </p>
<p>Pokemon eggs are basically an investment with much greater yield than 80.000₽.</p>
<p>I would get to raise and teach a pokemon from day 1. </p>
<p>It costs a lot of time, effort and food to raise him or her, but they would have a much greater potential than any random, wild pokemon would have.</p>
<p>Supposedly.</p>
<p>According to some internet articles.</p>
<p>People like Barry would obviously need to go for the cash price since he is already at the limit of what he can feed. </p>
<p>But Akari, Dawn or I would be better off with a pokemon egg.</p>
<p>&quot;And finally, place 3 gets the same as place 2 except for 20.000₽ instead.&quot;</p>
<p>Team Galactic is really splurging on us with that.</p>
<p>Maybe they are trying to recruit us early for the advertised wilderness expedition?</p>
<p>And if I manage to get place number 1, then I would get the egg <strong>and</strong> a TM.</p>
<p>I could get Giga Impact or some other insanely expensive move that I couldn&#x27;t hope to afford otherwise. </p>
<p>I could even sell it back to GTS and finance my adventures that way.</p>
<p>Or I could get Fire Punch. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s a very useful move on my to-buy list.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen up!&quot; Captain Braviary reigns in the chatting students again. &quot;This financial investment also comes with the stipulation that the participants need to prove their worth. And some of you had more of a challenge while others had none at all in the first round of battles.&quot;</p>
<p>Some seething gazes settle on me.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s why Ms. Mars here has reshuffled the remaining participants!&quot;</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>&quot;Take a look everyone!&quot; He reveals the changed tournament plan. </p>
<p>Some names are somehow yet again unreadable but the important ones aren&#x27;t.</p>
<p>FUCK! </p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no, no! That&#x27;s bullshit!&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t believe he did this to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Oof. You got fucked over worse than me!&quot; Comments Lucas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! No way! How lucky am I?&quot; Comments Zoey.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck me. Seriously?!&quot;</p>
<p>1st battle: ... Zoey Evans versus me.</p>
<p>2nd battle: Lucas Diamond versus Akari Platinum.</p>
<p>Even Buneary looks resigned. </p>
<p>We should have spent more time training for Play Rough! </p>
<p>Fuck! </p>
<p>We only have status moves!</p>
<p>&quot;Would Zoey Evans and Swole Solo please come down to the arena?&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t even get time to think. </p>
<p>They want me to lose. </p>
<p>These bastards.</p>
<p>My steps slow down unconsciously as my mind races on overdrive through my options.</p>
<p>Surrendering is the most obvious option, but I&#x27;m not going to just give up on the pokemon egg.</p>
<p>Double Hit, Quick Attack, Double Kick, Jump Kick and Flail are all 100% useless here. </p>
<p>But I might be able to use Quick Attack to dodge.</p>
<p>Buneary is slumped over on my shoulder. </p>
<p>Her disappointment in her own capabilities is obvious.</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s not her fault. It&#x27;s mine. </p>
<p>I&#x27;m the trainer. </p>
<p>And I wasted my time helping Dawn, when I should have covered our own weaknesses instead.</p>
<p>That was an expensive mistake.</p>
<p>My boot unexpectedly hits the dirt and I stumble a little.</p>
<p>No time to get distracted.</p>
<p>We still have status moves. Splash, Defense Curl, Baby-Doll Eyes, After You and Sweet Kiss.</p>
<p>Splash is as useless as it always has been. Maybe we could use it instead of Quick Attack to dodge vertically but that&#x27;s it.</p>
<p>Defense Curl and Baby-Doll Eyes are useless against special attackers like Misdreavus.</p>
<p>After You doesn&#x27;t work without a partner.</p>
<p>&quot;Swole Solo!&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You need to select your pokemon for the fight. Stop daydreaming.&quot; Says the combat instructor.</p>
<p>Daydreaming!? Are you shitting me you cunt?</p>
<p>Buneary heads down to her starting spot in the arena on her own. Misdreavus is already in her position and grins mischievously at us.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry Swole!&quot; Zoey shouts across the arena. &quot;Better luck next time?&quot;</p>
<p>Better luck next time... Better luck?</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready!&quot; Shouts Zoey.</p>
<p>My gaze refocuses on the battlefield. &quot;Hey! Buneary!&quot; I get her attention and she looks at me with crestfallen eyes and limp ears. &quot;We still have a chance to win this. Be ready for--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Shouts Captain Braviary, angrily. &quot;No last second orders! Show some sportsmanship, boy. Are you both ready?&quot;</p>
<p>Fuck! Right. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s kinda forbidden to communicate with your pokemon after your opponent has given the ready signal. </p>
<p>Which makes the ready signal kinda meaningless, since we aren&#x27;t ready yet!</p>
<p>But of course Zoey is ready. </p>
<p>She can safely use Thunder Wave or Confusion and all I have are hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>However... She must think that I don&#x27;t even have hopes and dreams. </p>
<p>Her confidence is far too obvious.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m ready!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thunder Wave!&quot; - &quot;Quick Attack, trust me!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary begins her speedy dash across the battlefield.</p>
<p>At the same time, Misdreavus rises into the air a little more while quickly charging Thunder Wave before releasing the move across the field.</p>
<p>I never got around to verifying Buneary&#x27;s ability. </p>
<p>If it isn&#x27;t Limber, we lose.</p>
<p>The wave washes over Buneary... But no static stays on her!</p>
<p>Yes! </p>
<p>She continues her sprint! We are immune to paralysis! Wuhu!</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?!&quot; - &quot;Change to Sweet Kiss, now!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary jumps the last few meters and shoots straight towards her opponent.</p>
<p>A faint pink glow coming from her face, indicating a weak, hasty Sweet Kiss. </p>
<p>But it&#x27;s still a damn quick one!</p>
<p>The fruits of our training.</p>
<p>&quot;No! Misdreavus, dodge!&quot;</p>
<p>But it&#x27;s too late! </p>
<p>Ahahaha! </p>
<p>The new order was too late and Misdreavus is too slow to dodge the speeding bunny!</p>
<p>Buneary&#x27;s face grazes Misdreavus&#x27; as she speeds past her but the pink glow lingers and seeps into Misdreavus&#x27; cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! Again! More power!&quot; As soon as Buneary hits the ground she turns around and sprints back to Misdreavus. </p>
<p>Her blood-lust is clearly visible in her eyes. She&#x27;s in it to win it, by any means necessary. </p>
<p>Just as I am.</p>
<p>&quot;Snap out of it! Use Confusion and kick her away!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dodge with Splash and continue with Sweet Kiss!&quot; </p>
<p>I want to win this. Making the fight harder for Zoey is not enough! </p>
<p>No, this will be our win!</p>
<p>A manic grin of my own spreads across my face.</p>
<p>A sudden burst of normal type energy lets Buneary bounce straight into the air, just when the red gems around Misdreavus neck glow the brightest.</p>
<p>A wave of sand, where Buneary was just half a second ago, is tossed towards the edge of the arena. </p>
<p>But Buneary&#x27;s jump brought her out of Confusion&#x27;s area of attack.</p>
<p>Buneary falls back to the ground and uses the rebound of Splash to direct herself towards Misdreavus.</p>
<p>&quot;Again! Confusion! We can&#x27;t let her touch us!&quot;</p>
<p>Misdreavus&#x27; red, bead necklace begins glowing again but a sudden discharge makes her wince in pain and causes her to close her eyes.</p>
<p>She doesn&#x27;t even see what&#x27;s coming. </p>
<p>Buneary is jumping straight for her face, her lips glowing in pink fairy type energy.</p>
<p><strong>Smooch</strong></p>
<p>Right in her fucking face! Misdreavus can&#x27;t keep herself afloat and falls to the ground.</p>
<p>A few camera flashes light up the arena.</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet Kiss, again! Don&#x27;t let her recover! Put all your effort into it!&quot;</p>
<p>Misdreavus is still reeling from hurting herself in her confused state and struggles to get back into the air. </p>
<p>That&#x27;s when Buneary secures Misdreavus face between her paws and kisses her right in the face again, to make the confusion even worse.</p>
<p>Some more camera flashes light up again.</p>
<p>... Uh... In her face? </p>
<p>My eyes wander away and look towards Zoey instead.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s blushing brightly.</p>
<p>My own face feels a little hot.</p>
<p>Shit. This is awkward now. </p>
<p>Another psychic backlash hits Misdreavus.</p>
<p>... But it&#x27;s working. </p>
<p>&quot;Uh... Use another Sweet Kiss. Ahem. Give it your all... We can win this... fight.&quot;</p>
<p>Misdreavus is barely still with us and Buneary shoots me a glare before charging even more fairy type energy and getting back into it.</p>
<p>But instead of the pink light seeping into Misdreavus, this time Misdreavus lights up pink and emits small balls of pink energy, which seep into Buneary instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Was that Draining Kiss?&quot; I mumble out as I try to distract myself from the view. </p>
<p>Buneary finishes her kissing session-- Her move-- Her attack! And gives me a nod.</p>
<p>Zoey is still blushing and too distracted to give new orders.</p>
<p>Draining Kiss... Draining Kiss! That&#x27;s a fairy type attack move! I don&#x27;t have to wait and hope for a win anymore!</p>
<p>&quot;Use Draining Kiss! Show her what you can do!&quot; Ehhh. &quot;Um, I mean, let&#x27;s win this. Yea.&quot;</p>
<p>This manages to snap Zoey out of her own state of confusion... Or arousal. With that amount of blushing, it could very well be arousal.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, since when can Buneary use Draining Kiss?!&quot; She shouts to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Since just now! I ignored that option because Buneary&#x27;s special attack sucks.&quot; I shout back.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah. Thanks! Yeah, I can see how she&#x27;s sucking... Misdreavus, get away from her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t let her get away! Knock her out with your smoo-- With your Draining Kiss!&quot;</p>
<p>Misdreavus tries to scramble away but Buneary easily catches back up and kisses her again. </p>
<p>And from this angle, I can see that it really isn&#x27;t just in the face, but on the mouth instead.</p>
<p>Damn! She&#x27;s really going ham in there!</p>
<p>I-- I really need to look away.</p>
<p>&quot;Misdreavus, hide in the shadows to wait out the confusion!&quot;</p>
<p>No! I won&#x27;t be able to hit her anymore.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t let up Buneary! We can&#x27;t let her escape!&quot;</p>
<p>Even more pink light seeps over from Misdreavus into Buneary as their kissing deepens even more. </p>
<p>I hope someone makes sure that the 8 year old guest trainer and Barry aren&#x27;t watching this.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; </p>
<p>All of a sudden, from the corners of my eyes I can see Chansey running into the fight and pushing Buneary off of Misdreavus.</p>
<p>&quot;Misdreavus is KO! Swole Solo and Buneary are the winners!&quot; </p>
<p>The combat instructor announces and the silent audience creates a scene of perfect awkwardness.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;You!&quot; Captain Braviary points me out. &quot;Get over here.&quot;</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>As I get closer to him, I can see Misdreavus receiving treatment from Chansey while Zoey stays beside her with a massive blush on her face.</p>
<p>Buneary hops to me and follows me with her own blush. I&#x27;m probably not much better off.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir?&quot; </p>
<p>He looks really fucking pissed. </p>
<p>His face is contorted in visible anger.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re on thin ice Mr. Solo. First, you were about to cheat. And then you even took your eyes off the battle! A few more seconds of carelessness and you would have killed Misdreavus!&quot;</p>
<p>Gulp. Shit. This is true. </p>
<p>I should always make sure to watch what Buneary does. </p>
<p>I can&#x27;t forget that she is dangerous.</p>
<p>&quot;If it was up to me, you could have said goodbye to your chance as a trainer just now. Maybe you could have become a trainer next year, after studying the damn rules again!&quot; He takes a deep breath. &quot;But you&#x27;re in luck.&quot;</p>
<p>He grits his teeth, still seething in anger but trying to calm down as he looks down on me. &quot;Instead you get a pop quiz. What happens when you kill another trainer&#x27;s pokemon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... My pokemon gets released and I lose my trainer license.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you know the damn consequences, why in Mew&#x27;s name did you look away?! And why did you feel the need to cheat?!&quot;</p>
<p>What do you mean, why did I need to cheat!? You forced a sudden battle on me! And it&#x27;s not even cheating outside of league regulated battles!</p>
<p>But instead of that, I calmly reply. &quot;My opponent changed too suddenly and our preparations were aimed against Lucas. I wasn&#x27;t thinking, and I wanted to maximize our win chances. It will not happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would better not happen again! And if I see you looking away from the battle again, I will make sure that you won&#x27;t participate in a trainer battle again. You hear me?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, get out of my sight. And get thicker pants if you have issues staying... calm in battle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>Fuck me. </p>
<p>I pick up Buneary and walk past Zoey back to our spot on the bleachers.</p>
<p>Buneary is seething in anger now. </p>
<p>Feels like she was close to ripping that guy&#x27;s throat out for talking down on us like that. </p>
<p>Well, talking down on me.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m the trainer, so everything we do wrong, is my fault. </p>
<p>That&#x27;s the rules.</p>
<p>Still. What a fucking asshole. </p>
<p>I hope I won&#x27;t have to see him again after this stupid tournament. </p>
<p>&#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s put the normal type pokemon up against the ghost pokemon! Isn&#x27;t that fun?&#x27;</p>
<p>Prick.</p>
<p>I just want to tear apart his neck and watch him bleed out.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Swole!&quot; Dawn rips me out of my thoughts.</p>
<p>Where the hell did that intrusive thought come from? Sheesh! Calm down Swole.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Dawn...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Congratulations on your win! Wow, I did not expect to see that turn of events. I thought for sure Zoey was going to win this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yea. I guess.&quot; I say as I sit down and put Buneary on my lap.</p>
<p>Man, that fucking asshole took all the fun away from the win.</p>
<p>&quot;The guy&#x27;s a massive asshole.&quot; Says Barry. &quot;He&#x27;s worse than your father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Snort. Shut up Barry. And, I think they are on the same level of assholeness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your dad didn&#x27;t make people around him cry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! Shut up Barry! I wasn&#x27;t crying last time!&quot; Dawn denies the implied accusations.</p>
<p>Kinda true. </p>
<p>It was the cruelty of the wilderness that made me cry. </p>
<p>Dad just made me feel like I&#x27;m not good enough.</p>
<p>This guy on the other hand actually made Dawn cry last Friday. </p>
<p>What an asshole.</p>
<p>&quot;We found you in the bathroom corner with mascara streaks and a picture of your family clutched in your hands.&quot; Akari reveals the truth. &quot;I understand the need for firm lessons, but this person is clearly an... asshole.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However,&quot; Akari continues, &quot;Let us talk about your fight instead. It took an entirely unexpected turn. Would you not say so as well? I can not say I have ever witnessed an opponent kissed into submission.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;You wanna try out that strategy?!&#x27; I stop myself from saying that.</p>
<p>&quot;I know, right?&quot; Lucas comments. &quot;But, did anyone else get weird vibes from that? Swole, why did you have to read us that perverted book of yours? You made pokemon sexual.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up. The book is just a history book. And it&#x27;s just one weird chapter. And... Buneary was just using Sweet Kiss and Draining Kiss... There&#x27;s nothing weird about that. Unless you make it weird. You weirdo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re the weirdo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hahaha.&quot; Zoey&#x27;s laughter interrupts our riveting dialogue. &quot;We&#x27;re all weirdos. You can&#x27;t tell me any of us managed to watch the fight without any weird thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p>She cradles her passed out Misdreavus in her arms and sits down with us.</p>
<p>Yea. But I&#x27;m not going to admit to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. Never had a weird thought in my life.&quot; - &quot;Me neither.&quot; - &quot;Nnnope.&quot; - &quot;Nu uh.&quot; - &quot;I believe the fight was sexually charged.&quot;</p>
<p>We all look at Akari with weirded-out looks and she seems confused as to why. &quot;What is the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>I can only shake my head. &quot;Anyway. Zoey.&quot;</p>
<p>I force myself to wipe the grin off my face. &quot;I need to apologize. First for the... sexual harassment. And then for not looking at the battle. I didn&#x27;t notice Misdreavus had already passed out...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry! I don&#x27;t think Misdreavus minded it too much and from my angle, I could see that Buneary had already stopped attacking by the time Captain Braviary stopped the battle.&quot; </p>
<p>She says as she affectionately strokes Misdreavus&#x27; hair, and Buneary starts blushing and avoiding my stare.</p>
<p>So I got chewed out for no damn reason?</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t believe that I thought the guy was cool...</p>
<p>&quot;HEY! I SAID LUCAS DIAMOND AND AKARI PLATINUM! MOVE YOUR FUCKING ASSES DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!&quot;</p>
<p>Sheesh! </p>
<p>The guy transformed from a cool hype-beast into an anger-machine. </p>
<p>Did someone shit in his lunch during break?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Someone <strong>should</strong> shit in his lunch.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Narrator-POV:</strong></p>
<p>The combat instructor is increasingly becoming more and more angry.</p>
<p>The poor students who have to face his anger are not even at fault. </p>
<p>His anger stems from the phone call he received shortly before recess.</p>
<p>A representative of a coalition between Team Galactic and the Platinum League has ordered him to push the students towards excellence and to test them for their problem solving capabilities at their limit.</p>
<p>On its own, the order had sounded innocuous and Captain Braviary had accepted the conditions for his continued employment without any complaints.</p>
<p>But after the first battle, he found out the problems that come from pushing young people in that direction.</p>
<p>Young people do not care about rules.</p>
<p>&#x27;My job is to release competent trainers. Not exceptional mercenaries!&#x27; Is what he thinks of the situation.</p>
<p>Without the rules of battle, an arena can easily turn into a slaughterhouse. </p>
<p>It is what he had experienced shortly after beginning his tour across the Sinnoh region:</p>
<p>A young, ambitious, fresh-out-of-school trainer had challenged him to battle without a referee, in the middle of nowhere. </p>
<p>Without further thinking about it, he accepted but in an accident near the end of the battle, the young trainer&#x27;s pokemon had killed his Rufflet.</p>
<p>The young trainer had his license revoked and was excommunicated from his social circle.</p>
<p>... But that did not manage to bring Rufflet back to the living.</p>
<p>Now, he is furious about the next generation of trainers.</p>
<p>&#x27;These young people... Some are better suited for the wilderness than for civilized society. And others should not be allowed to have any authority over pokemon at all.&#x27;</p>
<p>He believes that Swole Solo has no future as a trainer, but would make a great soldier instead. </p>
<p>The victory is his first priority, everything else comes second. Even if it kills his opponents or gets him disqualified from battles.</p>
<p>But even worse than that, is Paul Shinji. </p>
<p>Captain Braviary&#x27;s glare moves over the students and stays on the one student, who would not have managed to pass trainer school last year.</p>
<p>&#x27;The boy who risked his life and made his pokemon pay the price.&#x27;</p>
<p>Paul Shinji, also known as Asshole by his classmates, has 2 pokeballs on his belt. </p>
<p>One belonging to his Elekid, the other to a Teddiursa that he caught in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Both his Starly and his Chimchar were abandoned in the wilderness to fight Teddiursa&#x27;s angry mother off, while he ran away with his newest fighter.</p>
<p>Captain Braviary gnashes his teeth. </p>
<p>&quot;HEY! I SAID LUCAS DIAMOND AND AKARI PLATINUM! MOVE YOUR FUCKING ASSES DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, he did not call them down before. </p>
<p>But nobody cares about the truth when an angry man, muscles bulging, veins popping, face red with anger, calls them down.</p>
<p>Akari and Lucas scramble down the stairs to the battlefield.</p>
<p>&#x27;Akari Platinum. Another brat that cares nothing about rules. The footage from the wilderness survival lessons have shown that she is more like a wild pokemon than a human. She and Swole are even pulling their friends down with them. Absolutely disgusting savages. These children need Mew.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;GET ON WITH IT!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on out, Buizel!&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas throws out his pokeball and his Buizel comes out, ready to fight and with no visible exhaustion at all. </p>
<p>Unlike Cyndaquil who walks onto the battlefield a little more sluggish than usual. </p>
<p>Although an observer who had never seen Cyndaquil before would not be able to tell this.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sensei.&quot; - &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>Neither trainer gives an order to their pokemon. Both have picked out their strategies well in advance already.</p>
<p>For Cyndaquil, that is plan A. </p>
<p>For Buizel...</p>
<p>Buizel aims a Water Gun straight into the air while Cyndaquil produces a massive cloud of pitch black smoke to cover her part of the arena.</p>
<p>When the water falls back down in small, rain like droplets, the damage it does to Cyndaquil is negligible, but the disruption it causes to the smoke cloud is great enough for Buizel to see the outlines of his target through the smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! It worked! Now use Quick Attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Just as Buizel starts his dash across the arena, a bright purple light comes from the center of the smoke cloud.</p>
<p>The outline of Cyndaquil distorts and moves in an unnatural way, causing Buizel to doubt his aim and slow down.</p>
<p>Just then, two purple flames appear in the distortions. </p>
<p>Instead of eyes, the corrupted outline of Cyndaquil has purple flames.</p>
<p>They are malice. </p>
<p>The spectators watch in awe and suspense. </p>
<p>Buizel freezes in place. The eyes focus on him.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the distortions turn into a shady figure who speeds out of the smoke cloud. </p>
<p>It swiftly flies over the battlefield and smashes straight into Buizel, enveloping him in the process.</p>
<p>Goosebumps form on skin of the audience, the referee and on Lucas as the shade slowly enters his target and manifests in a nail, floating over Buizel&#x27;s head.</p>
<p>Akari and Cyndaquil have spent most of their time training up their ghost type and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>From the barely successful curse a week ago, to the scary monstrosity that paints a single, bleak future for Buizel.</p>
<p>Lucas realizes, that his plan to counter the curse, did in fact, not work. </p>
<p>The nail lowers an inch and finally, Lucas remembers that he still has a battle to fight. </p>
<p>&quot;Buizel, snap out of it! Use Water Gun! Spread it out but focus on the center of the smoke cloud!&quot;</p>
<p>Buizel recovers from the fright as his trainer&#x27;s voice breaks through his terror. </p>
<p>The water type energy charges up and a blast of water comes forth, aimed at the center of the Smokescreen.</p>
<p>From the darkness, the staccato sounds of many pops ring out. </p>
<p>The occasional, glittering Swift star shoots out of the smoke, only to slam back into the Water Gun while they try to home in on Buizel.</p>
<p>Lucas thinks as hard as he can to figure out a way to win. </p>
<p>Cyndaquil is still following her plan A without any adjustments at all.</p>
<p>She keeps waiting in the relative safety of her Smokescreen.</p>
<p>The nail lowers another inch and the end of the battle becomes obvious to even the slowest observers.</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit! We surrender!&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Dammit! We surrender!&quot; Lucas finally shouts out and Buizel turns to his trainer with an ashamed look on his face, at the same time as the nail dissipates into thin air.</p>
<p>Zoey starts cheering and Dawn, Barry and I follow her lead. </p>
<p>Akari and Cyndaquil are bloody brilliant.</p>
<p>Her plan A is just sooo OP if allowed to be completed.</p>
<p>&quot;Holy shit, I can&#x27;t believe how sick that Curse looked! It felt like I was going to get cursed just by being nearby!&quot; Zoey is amazed with the performance.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it&#x27;s more impressive how she won the battle without a single command. I can just barely get Buneary to remember 3 orders, but those 2 had the whole battle figured out from the start.&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary gives me a betrayed look but then changes the target of her look to Cyndaquil instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh shit!&quot; I suddenly remember. &quot;I need to fight against that next... I wonder if the Smokescreen is necessary at all for her Curse... Do you think it&#x27;s just a diversion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She always used the Smokescreen while training.&quot; Explains Barry. &quot;She is either serious about keeping her secrets a secret, or it&#x27;s necessary for the ghost type. She hasn&#x27;t told us, because she&#x27;s still waiting for the money from professor Rowan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Makes sense...&quot; In that case, chasing Cyndaquil around and staying away from any Flame Charge and Will-O-Wisp, still seems like the best option for us.</p>
<p>Cyndaquil also has some pretty good proficiency with Swift. </p>
<p>The homing effect of that move could be trouble... &quot;Buneary, could you deflect the Swift projectiles like Piplup&#x27;s Bubble Beam?&quot;</p>
<p>This seems to snap her out of her brooding and her head snaps back to me. </p>
<p>She nods confidently as she looks up to me from her position on my lap. &quot;Bun. Bunea- Buneary!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nono, I trust you. You&#x27;re definitely tough enough. I&#x27;m just verifying all I can before the fight. Just so you know, our basic strategy will be to stick to Cyndaquil like glue and to not give her a second to act unmoles-- without us kicking her ass.&quot;</p>
<p>Wait... molesting... hmmm... &quot;Actually, be ready to use Sweet Kiss if we get the opportunity. Everything we can do to make it harder for Cyndaquil to act.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, and be ready to tank a lot. Without Defense Curl or Baby-Doll Eyes we will lose or tie most direct trades.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bun!&quot; She replies and punches her fists together.</p>
<p>Ready and reliable. As always.</p>
<p>... I lean in a little closer. &quot;You&#x27;re the best.&quot; I say quietly, so the others don&#x27;t hear the cringe. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I say it often enough.&quot;</p>
<p>But Akari is probably the best trainer today.</p>
<p>We have many loose conditions that I know of. </p>
<p>And she might have who-knows-how-many aces hidden in her kimono sleeve.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter what happens next, you already went above and beyond against Zoey and I&#x27;m proud of you. Let&#x27;s give it our very best against Cyndaquil too, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bun!&quot;</p>
<p>I give her head a little pat and scratch, and then look back to the arena to catch the last battle of the quarter finals.</p>
<p>&quot;... and Paul Shinji! Get down here, now!&quot;</p>
<p>Never mind, I don&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>Akari is still down there, waiting for her turn, getting free healing from Chansey.</p>
<p>Zoey, Dawn and Barry are up here with me. None of them are looking at the battle either.</p>
<p>One of my arms sneaks around Buneary&#x27;s stomach and I hold her a little closer to me.</p>
<p>Should I watch the battle after all? </p>
<p>... Nah. I can just spectate their group&#x27;s finalists, when they battle it out in the semi-finale.</p>
<p>Probably going to be Asshole and Ash... Actually, Ash Ketchum, formerly known as Guest 3, was already put into the semi-finals bracket.</p>
<p>Me versus Akari is right after this... With any luck, Akari doesn&#x27;t get enough time to heal up at Chansey.</p>
<p>My other arm sneaks around Buneary too.</p>
<p>In my head, I&#x27;m just drifting along... </p>
<p>Thinking of bullshit that Cyndaquil could pull off against us.</p>
<p>What if they predict our Quick Attack opener and just counter with Flame Charge? </p>
<p>That would instantly cost us the match.</p>
<p>As for a Will-O-Wisp opener, I&#x27;m confident enough in Buneary&#x27;s skills to use the dirt to block it...</p>
<p>The dirt... The wet dirt? </p>
<p>... When did the arena turn muddy?</p>
<p>Was it when Buizel shot his Water Gun into the air to defog some of the Smokescreen?</p>
<p>If Buneary covered herself in mud, would the fire attacks become weaker?</p>
<p>I lean forward. This needs my whole focus. </p>
<p>That could be a winning strategy!</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t waste time or Cyndaquil just Curses us and disappears in a massive Smokescreen.</p>
<p>... But what if... our Quick Attack opening isn&#x27;t aimed at her, but at the ground in front of her?</p>
<p>That would counter both Will-O-Wisp and Flame Charge. And we would be close enough to counter Smokescreen.</p>
<p>&quot;Psst. Buneary. I have a new plan.&quot; I whisper to her and she looks up.</p>
<p>At some point she ended up pulled in tight to me, and her face is now directly below mine. Her ears are pressed into my chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you still know the first step of plan A?&quot; She nods confidently. &quot;Quick Attack. Right. But let&#x27;s throw up as much mud as we can, alright? Get yourself and Cyndaquil covered in as much mud as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>She is still for a moment, trying to understand why but eventually just accepts the order as it is with another nod.</p>
<p>&quot;Paul Shinji and Elekid are the winners! Next up are Swole Solo and Akari Platinum! Move it!&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>My heart is racing. If I win this, I will at least get 80.000₽ or better yet, a pokemon egg.</p>
<p>I walk down the steps and Akari is already waiting for me on the other side of the arena.</p>
<p>Her Cyndaquil is still in Akari&#x27;s arms and luckily, they didn&#x27;t have the time to get treated by Chansey!</p>
<p>&quot;You still remember everything?&quot; She nods determinedly. &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary and Cyndaquil jump to their ready positions at the same time.</p>
<p>I look toward the referee. </p>
<p>We need to be as fast as possible. </p>
<p>If Cyndaquil can set up a Smokescreen then we risk losing instantly.</p>
<p>Speed is going to be our greatest ally.</p>
<p>The referee looks back at me, then at Akari. </p>
<p>He is giving each of us a look of contempt and malice.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you both ready?!&quot;</p>
<p>I honestly expected him to just start the battle. &quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sensei.&quot; Akari responds as well. </p>
<p>Her eyes are focused on Buneary.</p>
<p>My own switch to Cyndaquil. </p>
<p>Akari is not going to give orders anytime soon, so I better watch her pokemon instead.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t need to watch the referee. </p>
<p>Buneary knows her orders. When the battle starts, she runs.</p>
<p>Watching Cyndaquil is most important.</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>Neither of us say a word but from the corner of my eye I can see Buneary picking up speed across the muddy ground.</p>
<p>Her feet, leaving deep prints in the muddy soil.</p>
<p>On the other side of the battle, Cyndaquil is preparing something. </p>
<p>Smokescreen? </p>
<p>I can&#x27;t tell.</p>
<p>But no matter what, Buneary is faster and jumps the last few meters for a higher angle of attack.</p>
<p>Then, a thick stream of black smoke rushes out of Cyndaquil&#x27;s snout and almost instantly covers her quarter of the field in an impenetrable veil of darkness. </p>
<p>Can&#x27;t see the results of our plan now.</p>
<p>&quot;Kick her out of there with Double Kick!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Counter with Flame Charge!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whoosh!</strong></p>
<p>Cyndaquil shoots out of the smoke cover. Flames struggling to escape her mud covered body.</p>
<p>Buneary comes running out just a second later. Muddy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! Stay on top of her! Quick Attack and Double Hit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Use Swift!&quot;</p>
<p>Cyndaquil rights herself in mid air and releases a small shower of stars.</p>
<p>&quot;Continue your attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary sprints after her target. Star shaped projectiles homing in on her. </p>
<p>Some are nimbly dodged and the projectiles slam into the ground. Failing to readjust their course. </p>
<p>Others are deflected. </p>
<p>They hit her limbs that are covered in the normal type energy of Quick Attack.</p>
<p>But some projectiles still hit Buneary and take their toll.</p>
<p>She tanks the move and persists with her attack.</p>
<p><strong>Bam! Pow! Pow!</strong></p>
<p>The combo attack hits the mark and spikes Cyndaquil into the soil.</p>
<p>Clumps of baked dirt are breaking off.</p>
<p>&quot;Flame Wheel! Get yourself some space!&quot;</p>
<p>New flames erupt from Cyndaquil&#x27;s back upon hearing the order. </p>
<p>Her muddy casing has burned dry and flaked off enough to let her use attacks again.</p>
<p>They are running away. </p>
<p>She can try but we won&#x27;t let her. </p>
<p>Buneary is already running after her, slowly closing the distance due to the difference in speed. </p>
<p>&quot;Stay close then attack with Jump Kick!&quot;</p>
<p>Jump Kick is slow. But Double Kick risks being countered by Flame Wheel.</p>
<p>Flame Wheel even has a chance to leave a burn so we can&#x27;t half-ass the trade.</p>
<p>Buneary sticks closely behind waiting for the best moment to strike. </p>
<p>Fighting type energy primed for the next move. </p>
<p>Ready to dodge at the first sign of a counter attack--</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Cyndaquil&#x27;s Flame Wheel starts shining brightly. </p>
<p>How?!</p>
<p>What are they planning? Are they somehow super heating their attack? </p>
<p>Overheat!? </p>
<p>&quot;Buneary, retreat!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cyndaquil!? What is happening? Are you okay?&quot; </p>
<p>Akari has no idea what is going on either. </p>
<p>Is it Overheat? Did she suddenly learn it?</p>
<p>The brightness increases more and more and I&#x27;m forced to turn my eyes away--</p>
<p>Oh no! </p>
<p>Oh shit! I know what that light means!</p>
<p>As fast as the light became blindingly bright, it also receded again, equally quickly.</p>
<p>In the place of Cyndaquil who, up until now, was rolling around in her Flame Wheel, is now a Quilava!</p>
<p>Her fur is mostly purple, just her stomach and chin are covered in yellow fur instead, and she is about as tall as Buneary now.</p>
<p>Her eyes have a piercing, dark ruby-red color and the flames on her back and on the back of her head are burning brightly with occasional motes of dark purple fire interspersed.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuuuuck.&quot; I let out a deep breath that I was holding in. &quot;Congratulations, Akari!&quot; I shout across the field.</p>
<p>This is so bad for me though.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Swole!&quot; Akari responds.</p>
<p>I take another look at Quilava.</p>
<p>She looks menacing. </p>
<p>Are the purple bits from her unusual affinity to the ghost type?</p>
<p>&quot;HEY! Stop your chit-chat and continue your fight!&quot; Comes the voice of the combat instructor.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, right! Buneary, get back into the fight with Quick Attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary, who had retreated closer to me, runs back into the battle.</p>
<p>&quot;Cyn-- Quilava! Use Flame Wheel!&quot;</p>
<p>Shit! Her Flame Wheel is visibly a lot stronger now! </p>
<p>There is no way we can compete with Quick Attack! &quot;Change to Jump Kick!&quot; </p>
<p>Will that be enough?</p>
<p>Her speed slows down and then she jumps feet first against the flaming shell of Quilava.</p>
<p>They clash for a moment, pushing against each other in the air as the type energy is expended and neutralized. </p>
<p>But then the equilibrium ends.</p>
<p>Buneary did not have enough time to charge up Jump Kick well enough and she was thrown back to me once again. </p>
<p>Then comes the recoil damage from a failed Jump Kick. </p>
<p>Sparks of energy arc over Buneary&#x27;s legs and lower body.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit!&quot; </p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t even think of that!</p>
<p>We lost the trade and took a huge chunk of damage.</p>
<p>Only a little bit of Quilava&#x27;s power broke through the trade but the recoil damage makes up for it!</p>
<p>Fuck! We can&#x27;t risk losing a trade like that again!</p>
<p>What can we even do now? The mud coatings on both Buneary and Quilava are already gone. </p>
<p>Reapplying that seems too risky. </p>
<p>Most moves could be countered and I still can&#x27;t give Quilava time to set up any of her bullshit.</p>
<p>And the random evolution is too much!</p>
<p>Suddenly, I notice Swift projectiles coming in. </p>
<p>I was thinking for too long. </p>
<p>&quot;Buneary, dodge as much as you can. And get closer to Quilava.&quot;</p>
<p>I know that a closer distance will make dodging projectiles harder but we just can&#x27;t afford to stay too far away.</p>
<p>Too many projectiles are hitting Buneary, despite her best efforts and she stumbles a little.</p>
<p>I need to think of something quickly or she will take the punishment for my incompetence!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Buneary.&quot; I change to a whisper. </p>
<p>Everything to increase our chances. &quot;Feint an attack. Rush in and dodge. Then Pound and Double Hit.&quot;</p>
<p>Then with a shout, &quot;Quick Attack! Don&#x27;t give any ground!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Counter with Flame Charge.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes! She took the bait! </p>
<p>Unless she baits me into believing she took the bait?</p>
<p>Anyway, Buneary is charging Pound and running towards Quilava. It looks indistinguishable to a Quick Attack.</p>
<p>Especially to an outside observer who doesn&#x27;t know exactly how fast she usually is.</p>
<p>And especially when any slowing down could be excused by exhaustion.</p>
<p>Only I know exactly how fast she should be right now.</p>
<p>Right before the two pokemon clash together, Buneary suddenly banks to the right. Kicking a bit of mud up into Quilava&#x27;s face in the process and causing Flame Charge to miss my nimble bunny.</p>
<p>Buneary instantly turns back around and strikes out at Quilava.</p>
<p>An overhead Pound. A punch with her left paw and another punch with her right paw. </p>
<p>&quot;Jump Kick! Charge it good!&quot; We can&#x27;t rush the move again or else Quilava can just break through and overpower us.</p>
<p>Buneary and Quilava are breathing heavily a couple of meters apart from each other. Buneary is standing still, trying to collect the energy needed for the move.</p>
<p>&quot;Use Leer!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Attack now! Then follow up with Double Kick!&quot;</p>
<p>My eyes flick over to Akari. </p>
<p>How? How can she capitalize on every single move I make? She even looks calm and collected while doing it!</p>
<p>My eyes dart back. </p>
<p>Once again Buneary is forced to use a half-assed Jump Kick. She jumps the small distance to her target and Quilava tanks it.</p>
<p>Quilava remains steadfast. She just barely slides back by the move. </p>
<p>Her evolution made her too strong!</p>
<p>During her slide, her glare intensifies. Her sharp eyes tighten up until only her bright red orbs remain in my view.</p>
<p>Some white glow seeps into Buneary.</p>
<p>Then Buneary catches up with the knock-back and kicks Quilava twice again. Pushing her a little further back in the process.</p>
<p>&quot;Ember!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dodge!&quot;</p>
<p>Quilava breathes in deeply. </p>
<p>A tight stream of Ember shoots out. </p>
<p>But a lot less projectiles than with Piplup&#x27;s Bubble Beam.</p>
<p>Buneary tries to step between the projectiles, like she did in her sparring against Piplup. </p>
<p>But she loses her footing in the mud and slips.</p>
<p>Shit! &quot;Use the mud!&quot;</p>
<p>The stream of fire focuses on her prone body and pummels into her.</p>
<p>One blast after another hits her for little effect as she keeps rolling herself in mud.</p>
<p>&quot;Change into Flame Wheel and jump up!&quot; - &quot;Dodge with Splash!&quot;</p>
<p>Wait what?</p>
<p>Quilava manages to perfectly flow the Ember attack into her Flame Wheel and rushes towards Buneary who jumped out of the way with a short burst of normal type.</p>
<p>But Quilava follows her into the air with her own jump.</p>
<p>Fuck!</p>
<p>How!?</p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Retaliate with Flail!&quot; I shout a little louder. </p>
<p>Buneary was picked up in Quilava&#x27;s rush and they are both tumbling over the field... Quilava is doing it on purpose. </p>
<p>Buneary had no choice.</p>
<p>&quot;Retreat from Buneary!&quot;</p>
<p>Akari orders her pokemon away from the power-move but it&#x27;s already too late!</p>
<p><strong>Bam! Pow!</strong></p>
<p>While still tumbling around, Buneary&#x27;s bright shining leg and ear hit Quilava in the back, and even manage to break through the remainder of her Flame Wheel.</p>
<p>A smile forms on my face.</p>
<p><strong>Pow!</strong></p>
<p>Then another punch hits the mark! Quilava tries to run away but Buneary is relentless. </p>
<p>One strike, punch, stomp and hit after another turn the tides back in our favor.</p>
<p>And the hits go on and on with no end in sight... Except... when Buneary eventually runs out of steam.</p>
<p>Her last punch ends with her having to brace her weight instead. </p>
<p>Quilava doesn&#x27;t look so good anymore.</p>
<p>One of her eyes is swollen shut. She&#x27;s down on all fours and I doubt she can still get up into her usual upright position again.</p>
<p>Her flames are sputtering but she looks determined to continue the fight.</p>
<p>But Buneary doesn&#x27;t look much better.</p>
<p>Her breaths are heavy. </p>
<p>Her body is battered and bloody. </p>
<p>She&#x27;s close to passing out.</p>
<p>Buneary... I hate seeing her like this.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re out of juice and running on fumes at best.</p>
<p>Should--... Should I surrender? For her sake?</p>
<p>&quot;Bu-- nie...&quot; All of a sudden, Buneary clutches her chest and falls over. </p>
<p>Some fire type energy is dissipating from a burn mark that I hadn&#x27;t noticed until now.</p>
<p>&quot;Buneary is KO!&quot; Shit... </p>
<p>Camera flashes and applause fill my senses but I can only see Buneary and hear my own heartbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Akari Platinum and Quilava are the winners! Now get your pokemon healed.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Buneary!&quot; I rush over to my pokemon as soon as the referee ends the battle.</p>
<p>She&#x27;s in bad shape. </p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s my fault. </p>
<p>I don&#x27;t even know how I could have won that.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a failure.</p>
<p>Somewhere, in the back of my mind, I know that she will be fine after a bit of rest and some food. </p>
<p>But right now, I can only see the dirty, bloodstained, matted fur and her limp body.</p>
<p>I pick her up in my arms and bring her over to Chansey who is waiting on standby. </p>
<p>She gets to work immediately, casting a Heal Pulse and getting some bandages and band aids ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Chan! Chansey, chan!&quot; She... reprimands me?</p>
<p>&quot;I know... I suck.&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary seems to be far worse for wear than the other pokemon after their losses.</p>
<p>She always pushes herself to the very end.</p>
<p>At least I didn&#x27;t surrender... I doubt that I would ever hear the end of it if I had surrendered.</p>
<p>Buneary is a fighter. </p>
<p>I know, the loss is going to be painful to her but losing without giving it her all would be even worse.</p>
<p>My hand stretches out to pet Buneary&#x27;s head, but it gets slapped away! Buneary!?-- </p>
<p>No... By Chansey... She is still busy putting bandages on her left ear.</p>
<p>The damage she took was immense.</p>
<p>The sudden sound of thunder interrupts my fussing.</p>
<p>I turn around and notice that the next battle has already started and it looks like Ash&#x27;s Pikachu is fighting against Asshole&#x27;s Elekid.</p>
<p>Pikachu is in a much better shape than Elekid. It looks like this is Pikachu&#x27;s first battle today.</p>
<p>They are far less evenly matched than me and Akari.</p>
<p>Elekid looks like he is just barely keeping up.</p>
<p>I look back to Buneary.</p>
<p>She would have won against Pikachu.</p>
<p>I might not be allowed to interfere with Chansey&#x27;s work, but I can at least hold Buneary&#x27;s paw and keep my focus on her.</p>
<p>Her breathing actually calms down a little bit as I hold her paw.</p>
<p>Her chest rises and falls steadily now. </p>
<p>Her bloody fur doesn&#x27;t convey the image of an almost dead pokemon, but of a resting warrior instead.</p>
<p>My resting warrior. Always giving it a 100 percent.</p>
<p>I just wish we had won the battle. </p>
<p>But Quilava just became so much stronger in the middle of the battle. </p>
<p>What could anyone have done against that sort of thing?</p>
<p>&quot;Good grief. You did really well, Buneary. You almost won, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hello.&quot; Wah! &quot;I-- Are you alright?&quot; Akari asks and she looks at me weirdly as I scramble to un-startle myself.</p>
<p>Akari sneaked up on me out of nowhere!</p>
<p>Well... I think she was standing and waiting for Chansey the whole time. </p>
<p>And at some point Chansey had even switched from caring for Buneary to Quilava.</p>
<p>&quot;Yea. I&#x27;m alright. What&#x27;s up?&quot;</p>
<p>She looks up in thought. &quot;Uhm... the clouds are up? Are you certain you are alright? The sensei has given us a short break after Ash and... A-Hole finished their fight. You looked like you did not notice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m alright. &#x27;What&#x27;s up&#x27; just means &#x27;how are you&#x27;. But thanks for telling me about the break. Who won? Ash, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed. Ash has managed to secure the victory. As for A-Hole, what will you be doing for your battle for place 3? Will you finally show us your second pokemon?&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? &quot;My second pokemon? What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>She points at my crotch. &quot;Is there no second pokemon in there?&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;My second pokemon is Mudicc.&#x27; I stop myself from saying that.</p>
<p>Instead, I look down and indeed, there is a second pokeball on my belt. &quot;Oh! That one is empty. I keep it ready in case I want to capture something... Shi-- Did you say battle for place 3? I forgot about that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that explains it. And I am convinced that you will be able to figure something out. Good luck, Swole.&quot;</p>
<p>With that she turns away from me and fusses over Quilava.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, pick up my healed Buneary and head back to our other friends.</p>
<p>They are still at our spot and they haven&#x27;t left for the break. </p>
<p>Dawn looks a little worried about Buneary when she spots my approach.</p>
<p>Barry seems more worried about my next battle. </p>
<p>We talked a little bit and I pet Buneary absentmindedly.</p>
<p>Eventually the topic of my battle against Asshole is brought up and I am reminded of a rumor that went through the students since the start of the week.</p>
<p>Supposedly, Asshole lost Chimchar and Starly in the wilderness and had gotten a Teddiursa instead. </p>
<p>And since Elekid will be out of commission, that means Teddiursa will be my most likely opponent.</p>
<p>With Buneary&#x27;s powerful repertoire of fighting type moves, this would be actually a good matchup for me.</p>
<p>As for how Buneary is going to be in a fighting condition... I pull out my magical solution.</p>
<p>The 1.500₽ revive.</p>
<p>I have a really good chance to win 20.000₽. A 1.500₽ investment, is definitely a good financial decision.</p>
<p>Buneary would also be incredibly pissed if she lost another fight without ever getting the opportunity to defend herself.</p>
<p>I hold out the revive crystal. </p>
<p>A thumb-sized, sleek, yellow octahedron. A bit taller than wide.</p>
<p>It... does not come with any kind of screwed-on cap or spray lever. How am I supposed to use that?</p>
<p>I press it to Buneary&#x27;s chest... for no effect. Does she need to eat it?</p>
<p>I try opening her mouth and pushing the crystal in. </p>
<p>It fits and suddenly, it releases green particles that stream further into her mouth, and then out of her mouth as well to cover her from ear to toe, inside and out.</p>
<p>Instantly, she opens her eyes. They dart around before locking into mine. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you. You&#x27;re finally awake?&quot;</p>
<p>Tears well up in Buneary&#x27;s eyes despite my best efforts to distract her with a shitty joke.</p>
<p>~&quot;I&#x27;m sorry... I-- I&#x27;m a failure!&quot; She apologizes through hiccups. She&#x27;s trying not to cry as she blames herself for my loss.</p>
<p>&quot;Heyyy... It wasn&#x27;t your fault.&quot; I place my hand at the back of her head and pull her in closer. </p>
<p>&quot;That fight was super close. And if it was anyone&#x27;s fault, then it was mine. I decided to help Dawn. I decided that you don&#x27;t need higher intensity training. I, as the trainer, am at fault. Please don&#x27;t blame yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe if we blasted through all our berries, then she could have trained enough to get the win...</p>
<p>But Buneary does not look convinced. </p>
<p>I think she believes that Quilava was simply too strong for her. That she couldn&#x27;t have done anything against her, no matter how much she trained in the short time we had.</p>
<p>But she suppresses her tears further.</p>
<p>I lean in further to hug Buneary and, surprisingly, she even hugs me back.</p>
<p>&quot;You know... We&#x27;re not out of the tournament just yet.&quot; This finally manages to stop her sniffling. &quot;Do you remember the asshole who called us losers in the park?&quot;</p>
<p>She nods immediately as she remembers the event. </p>
<p>The moment that we made a sworn enemy.</p>
<p>&quot;We get to beat him up in the next round. His Elekid lost to Pikachu and now we can battle him for place 3.&quot;</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Narrator-POV:</strong></p>
<p>And so, Buneary&#x27;s mood was greatly improved.</p>
<p>With a devilish grin, she sat and watched as the finale played out. </p>
<p>For the whole time, she was looking forward to her next fight. To finally put Paul in his place.</p>
<p>Except for when Swole fed her gross tasting berries to ensure she is back in top performance.</p>
<p>Ash and Akari fought out the finale in a less than epic battle for their student-championship.</p>
<p>Ash, to the surprise of many, has chosen to fight with Aipom against Akari&#x27;s Quilava. </p>
<p>Reasoning that all of his pokemon should get a turn in the tournament.</p>
<p>His earlier fights were done with his Starly and his newly caught Turtwig.</p>
<p>This time, Akari had used her personal berry stash, in order to get Quilava back into tip top shape. </p>
<p>She has learned from her fight with Swole, not to trust Chansey&#x27;s recovery performance. </p>
<p>And Ash had taken a page out of Swole&#x27;s book of strategies and attempted to win by giving Quilava no time to set up anything. </p>
<p>But Quilava simply ended up overpowering Aipom&#x27;s very first attack with Flame Charge, which gave her the necessary speed to steamroll the rest of the battle.</p>
<p>When Buneary was not busy shooting her arch-nemesis deadly looks, she was listening to Swole who discussed battle strategy with her.</p>
<p>With the finale of the tournament decided, usually the school&#x27;s prize would be awarded now, and under-performing students would be told to remain for another week. </p>
<p>But since there are prizes for the top 3 students, another match is scheduled into the plan.</p>
<p>Captain Braviary calls down the young hero and the young antagonist. </p>
<p>A proponent of comradery and cooperation versus the guy who beats perfection into his pokemon, and steals children from their mothers.</p>
<p>In a last second decision, Swole decides to return Buneary to her pokeball in order to abuse the rumors of his second and to cause confusion and uncertainty in his opponent.</p>
<p>A strategy that Captain Braviary would call cowardly and an antithesis to professional pokemon battles.</p>
<p>He believes the goal of a battle should be to entertain. </p>
<p>Winning is not the end-goal to sacrifice entertainment and safety for. </p>
<p>But he is the only person in the school&#x27;s backyard-stadium who thinks like that.</p>
<p>Swole and Paul meet on the battlefield. </p>
<p>Their balls are already in their hands. Ready to fight.</p>
<p>&quot;Go.&quot; - &quot;Don&#x27;t kill them, Buneary!&quot;</p>
<p>Each trainer flings their pokeballs. </p>
<p>Paul throws a regular pokeball, as if tossing away some trash, while Swole passionately throws a premier ball high in the air.</p>
<p>However, despite the passion for the fight, Swole immediately regrets his choice of catchphrase. </p>
<p>He now realizes that it was cringe.</p>
<p>Out of the premier ball, comes an energetic Buneary, who does a flip in the air before landing in a battle ready position, like a boxer.</p>
<p>Her ears are fully extended and her stance is wide.</p>
<p>On the other side of the arena, appears a small, light brown, teddy-bear like pokemon with a crescent moon shape in his fur. </p>
<p>A Teddiursa.</p>
<p>His posture is submissive and frightened. </p>
<p>His posture only got a lot worse, when he spotted Buneary, and he backed up.</p>
<p>Buneary was dirty, grinning evilly and covered in dried blood.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t disappoint me.&quot; </p>
<p>However, his fear of the known danger is greater than the fright of the unknown one; Causing him to retreat away from his trainer and back to the relative safety of the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you both ready?&quot; The referee asks the participants one last time for the day and the participants both give their own response. </p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; - &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Begin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Belly Drum.&quot;</p>
<p>Swole had expected an easy fight but Belly Drum, a move that deals a lot of damage to the user but maximizes their attacking power in the process, destroys his plan in the first turn.</p>
<p>Baby-Doll Eyes would be useless now, he thinks. &quot;Switch to Quick Attack!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary dismisses the collected fairy type energy and begins her sprint across the battlefield while Teddiursa slaps his own stomach with normal type infused hits.</p>
<p>His tiny, stuffed animal-like body expands and bulges as his physical strength increases drastically.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that Teddiursa did not receive proper training yet, as the speed with which he completes his order is too slow. </p>
<p>He also did not receive any prior strategic heads-up and had wasted even more precious time because of that.</p>
<p>Just as he finished Belly Drum, Buneary body-checks into him with Quick Attack. </p>
<p>&quot;Double Hit!&quot; - &quot;Slash!&quot;</p>
<p>Buneary immediately switches into the weaker Double Hit and strikes Teddiursa with one punch for each arm. </p>
<p>All that in the time it takes for Teddiursa to prepare his own move.</p>
<p>&quot;Splash to dodge!&quot;</p>
<p>The extremely powerful Slash comes from Teddiursa&#x27;s clawed paw and tries to slice Buneary, but she simply hops straight into the air with the leftover normal type energy as fuel for the move.</p>
<p>&quot;Now Jump Kick!&quot; Swole shouts out his next order as Buneary is still ascending further into the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Use Payback!&quot; Paul intends to use Teddiursa&#x27;s slower attack time in order to prepare Payback. </p>
<p>A move that doubles in power when the user takes damage while preparing the move.</p>
<p>Buneary smoothly turns the descent of her Splash into a Jump Kick with both feet aimed at her opponent&#x27;s head.</p>
<p>Teddiursa closes his eyes in preparation and tanks the super effective hit. </p>
<p>He was ordered to take the hit and use Payback. So he will do it even if he does not want to.</p>
<p><strong>Bam!</strong></p>
<p>Her feet smash into Teddiursa&#x27;s face. </p>
<p>Critical hit.</p>
<p>&quot;Double Kick! Knock him away.&quot;</p>
<p>Teddiursa tries to open his eyes but one is already swollen shut from the damage. </p>
<p>His Payback move increases dramatically in power but all he can focus on are the kicks that smash into his young body and knock him out of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Then... nothing. Teddiursa passes out.</p>
<p><br />---<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Pathetic.&quot; Asshole immediately returns his pokemon, without waiting for the referee to end the fight.</p>
<p>Captain Braviary seems to enrage further because of that breach in procedure.</p>
<p>Asshole is such a fucking asshole. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s obviously not Teddiursa&#x27;s fault that we wrecked them.</p>
<p>He was ordered to hurt himself and then couldn&#x27;t manage to hit a single attack because he wasn&#x27;t trained well enough.</p>
<p>&quot;What a garbage trainer.&quot; I say loud enough for Asshole to hear and Buneary laughs at his expense.</p>
<p>The combat instructor either missed or ignores my unsportsmanlike behavior because he is still busy glaring at Asshole.</p>
<p>&quot;Teddiursa is KO! Swole Solo and Buneary are the winners!&quot; He finally announces. &quot;You, stay behind. And you, Mr. Solo, you should go over to the other winners for your prizes and photos.&quot;</p>
<p>Sweeeeet! 20k here we come!</p>
<p>While Asshole receives his tongue lashing, I make my way over to Ash and Akari. </p>
<p>They are both currently engaging with reporters and the woman with red hair. </p>
<p>Ms Mars, I think?</p>
<p>Akari, as the winner and as one of the tuition-students, is receiving a lot of attention from the Jubilife TV reporters.</p>
<p>Ash, as a representative of professor Oak&#x27;s field researchers, is collecting a few questions as well.</p>
<p>Once I join their group, a few reporters usher us into a group pose for some pictures and resume questioning places 1 and 2.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a little demeaning to be pushed into an obvious 3rd place in the pictures and then be ignored by the reporters.</p>
<p>Especially because Buneary would have wiped the floor with Aipom.</p>
<p>With luck on their side, Pikachu could be a tossup. He is clearly well trained but we have an advantage against electric types with Limber.</p>
<p>But no matter how good I actually am, no reporter cares about me because I&#x27;m not the winner, I&#x27;m not the underdog and I&#x27;m not selected by professor Oak.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Standing around while the other two are being questioned feels really cucked.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Finally, after Captain Braviary was done with Asshole, he approached us, talked with Ms Mars and she left and got the prizes.</p>
<p>An incubator with silvery egg inside and two booklets stacked on top.</p>
<p>She hands Akari the incubator and they talk for a moment. But Akari seems a little distracted. I would be too with a mystery egg. </p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Then she gives Ash and me one booklet each and calls us &#x27;strapping, young winners&#x27;.</p>
<p>I like her. She seems nice.</p>
<p>And the money should already be transferred to our accounts by Team Galactic. </p>
<p>She made doubly sure that we know it comes directly from &#x27;Team Galactic&#x27;, not GAG, further supporting my conspiracy theory of a recruitment scheme.</p>
<p>The booklet, or rather magazine, is a price index for the items currently traded at the GTS. </p>
<p>It has &#x27;GTS&#x27; printed in big, bold, red letters on the cover page with &#x27;Global Trade Station&#x27; in a smaller, yellow font underneath.</p>
<p>The cover image is a couple of rare trainer items and collectors items displayed on podiums with short descriptions and page numbers underneath.</p>
<p>One such item is a literal gold-crown designed to be worn only by pokemon of the Eevee and Pikachu evolution line. </p>
<p>For a ridiculous price of 999.999₽!</p>
<p>On another podium are a Beedrillite and a Mawilite, each going for 30.000₽. </p>
<p>They are listed on the same page, so I&#x27;m guessing all available mega stones will be there.</p>
<p>I quickly leaf through the pages to the mega stones and the prices are looking bleak. </p>
<p>They are all priced at 30k₽. And not all discovered mega stones are available for purchase right now.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is no Lopunnite. </p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Solo?&quot; Huh?</p>
<p>I close my shopping magazine and look around. </p>
<p>Oh. My. Arceus. </p>
<p>A reporter is interested in me!</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>She is wearing a long skirt and a sleeveless, brown blouse. Her hair and eyes are a dark shade of blue and she has a cameraman following her around.</p>
<p>I immediately change my posture and employ all the little things mom taught me to be proper and sophisticated.</p>
<p>Buneary follows suit, using as much as she can from the limited education in etiquette that I managed to teach her.</p>
<p>&quot;I am working for Jubilife TV. Are you willing to answer a few questions for us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. I am happy to answer any questions you have.&quot; </p>
<p>Fuck yea! No more reporter-cuckery!</p>
<p>&quot;First off, you are a field researcher, sponsored by professor Rowan. Is that correct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I started working with him this year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is your opinion on Sinnoh trainers traditionally starting their journey at the age of 14? The contestants, who were ranked higher than you are both trainers who had their pokemon for a longer time already. Wouldn&#x27;t you agree that Sinnoh trainers are losing a competitive advantage through our traditions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I strongly believe that sending out children at the age of 10 is highly irresponsible. My father made me capture Buneary here, on my own earlier this year.&quot; </p>
<p>I pet Buneary on my shoulder for emphasis. &quot;I almost died in the process and I was definitely not ready for the possible brutality of pokemon.&quot;</p>
<p>I shudder a little at some of the resurfacing memories. </p>
<p>&quot;Pokemon can be seriously dangerous if you meet the wrong ones. Akari-- I mean, Miss Platinum, is an exceptional trainer who I believe has received serious survival training in the past and was ready for the wilderness. That is definitely not the case for Ash Ketchum.&quot;</p>
<p>I had to save his ass and he got 2nd place...</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Ketchum is entirely unaware of the possible danger that pokemon possess and his behavior is rather childlike. A traveling companion from the Kanto region of his is even older and also seems to act childish. This makes me fear that sending trainers out as children causes them to stop their social development and they mentally remain children for who-knows how long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, you believe that the cons outweigh the pros and Sinnoh should continue with their tradition?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct. Furthermore, I believe the competitive edge only exists in trainers that are in the same age-bracket. If you compare the champions of each region, then Cynthia is widely considered the strongest, followed by Steven Stone from Hoenn and Leon from Galar. Hoenn, I believe, starts their journeys with 13 and Galar with 16.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might have a point there. Next question, what do you plan to make of your career?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to train to surpass Cynthia, and become the Sinnoh champion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hoho? A lofty goal.&quot; She has a pleasant sounding laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t aim high, you won&#x27;t reach high.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is certainly a good philosophy to live by. Last question, which gym leader will have to look out for the new rising star to challenge them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of them! Haha, but Byron, the steel type trainer will need to look out first. From what I have seen on the internet, Buneary&#x27;s style of battle will be best suited against his defensive style. And since Canalave City has access to the ocean, I can also capture a good water type pokemon there. So,&quot; </p>
<p>I turn directly to the camera man. &quot;You hear that Byron? I&#x27;m coming for you!&quot;</p>
<p>I give the camera the flashiest smile I can give and the reporter signals the end of the interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for the interview. That was a good performance, Mr. Solo. I will try my best to get this into tomorrow&#x27;s article. But don&#x27;t expect the front page.&quot; She winks. &quot;That will be reserved for the Platinum League results, for at least a week. Goodbye Mr. Solo. And I hope to interview you at some point again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, for the interview. And goodbye Ms...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Karla Kolumna. But you can call me Karla. Ms Kolumna makes me sound old.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You certainly don&#x27;t look old, haha. Goodbye Karla.&quot; I wave her off.</p>
<p>And with that, the last reporter who had remained, left the premise leaving only some of the students, Ash, Brock and Captain Braviary behind.</p>
<p>I let out a deep breath and relax a little again as I look around the remaining people.</p>
<p>Barry has apparently hit it off with Ash and Brock and they are talking animatedly.</p>
<p>I notice that Chansey looks extremely exhausted and has collapsed to a seated position. </p>
<p>The poor pokemon has been on overdrive healing-duty for the whole day.</p>
<p>I also notice Captain Braviary talking with Akari and I&#x27;m close enough to eavesdrop a little. I doubt they are talking about anything private, otherwise I would leave them alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I understand correctly, that I get to choose any? Can I not choose the most expensive one and sell it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sadly, no.&quot; Answers Captain Braviary. &quot;It has to do with the economy behind it. Stronger trainers finance themselves by selling their moves through major companies like Silph Corp, Devon Corp or our Galactic Acquisition Group. The Leagues supports that practice because it means they don&#x27;t have to pay their top trainers as much money. But it also means that TMs cannot be legally resold.&quot;</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t? Damn.</p>
<p>He continues. &quot;Making a TM is also an extremely energy intensive process and this drives up the prices of them even more.&quot;</p>
<p>There was also a thing in the news a few months ago. The League deliberated over making TMs single use. </p>
<p>For more profit. But it was rejected because making them costs too much electricity. The cities need electricity too, after all.</p>
<p>If TMs were made single use, then cities would experience blackouts because trainers use up all of the power.</p>
<p>&quot;Understood. I have but one last question now.&quot; Akari says. &quot;What are Tea Ems?&quot;</p>
<p>I audibly face-palm and they both look at me for a moment and Akari blushes a little bit.</p>
<p>&quot;TMs or technical machines, are reusable devices that slot into your pokeball like a DVD. You can imagine them as guides for your pokemon. If your pokemon can learn a TM move, then they receive a great, instinctual boost to their proficiency. A lot of beginner trainers use TMs in order to teach their pokemon a type that they haven&#x27;t been able to use before.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh? It goes in like a DVD? I thought you put the button of the pokeball into the hole of the TM disc.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Akari seems surprised at their usefulness. &quot;In that case, I will take Protect. It is a move that I wanted to teach every pokemon I get.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright. I will make sure a copy will be delivered to your room by Sunday. Goodbye.&quot; Captain Braviary turns away, returns his Chansey and leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;Farewell.&quot; Akari returns the goodbye and turns to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello there, Swole. Will you explain how a DeeVeeDee slots into a pokeball?&quot;</p>
