<p>It took Deek quite a while to talk comfortably... &quot;So, Deek. You mentioned your parents fear another great war. Do you recon--&quot; Despite the excitement egging her on ever since her newest friend woke up, Mary still has the awareness to interrupt herself when she spots him stifling yet another yawn.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you weary?&quot; Concern oozes from her voice, thick as honey, though she drifts off, as if not truly speaking to him. &quot;Of course you are - it is still the dead of night. A young lad like you ought to get the rest he needs. How else will you be fit enough to aid your family come the morrow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not - yaaawn - tired.&quot;</p>
<p>She returns to the present, authority ringing with a finality that won&#x27;t allow any backtalk. &quot;You need rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can talk some more.&quot; He talks back.</p>
<p>&quot;Hush now. We can talk a lot more tomorrow. You would do well to close your eyes and sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s too cold to sleep.&quot; He rubs his shivering body as the ice-cold being hovers nearby - not that Deek would have it any other way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... Apologies, I&#x27;m being a terrible host, aren&#x27;t I? I will fetch you a blanket. You just lie down and wait, deal?&quot; Her voice cuts off at the end when she floats through the ceiling.</p>
<p>Deek waits a dozen minutes in the dark with nothing to do. Eventually, he ignores the mattress&#x27; smell and rests his eyes for just a moment. Quiet breathing and soft snores sound from the bed as Mary returns.</p>
<p>She coos at the sight, holding the most intact blanket she could find to her chest. If asked where the damage came from, Mary would insist it was definitely not because of the way she dragged it across the floor. Surely it was the moths chewing holes.</p>
<p>A little, sleepy, curled-up boy. She imagines this is what she was meant to see, if only she had lived long enough to bear her own.</p>
<p>With the tenderness of a mild winter breeze, she moves the blanket to cover his soundly sleeping form, smoothing it out so that every corner aligns perfectly. Then, unable to hold it any longer, a soft giggle escapes her - her happiness has grown too overwhelming to contain. Fleeing into the ground, careful to avoid the basement&#x27;s barrier, she laughs without holding back. All the emotions she kept bottled break free in a symphony of muffled laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Another human! Oh God, finally! We&#x27;re going to do so many fun things together!&quot; And then she sobs. Her body shivers and chest heaves, but the tears won&#x27;t come out. &quot;It&#x27;s been so long. So long without another soul to speak with. So, so long... Oh, thank you, God, for sending me this blessing.&quot;</p>
<p>Another couple of laughs trill from deep within her chest - well, not really - before she floats up to the boy with a glowing smile on her face - also, not really. Careful to avoid touching him with her cold body, she hovers on ground level as if lying flat on her stomach.</p>
<p>She props up her head and stares at him. She watches him sleep, his chest&#x27;s rise and fall. Her body remembers the long-forgotten but deeply ingrained motions as she mimics the movements. It almost feels like she&#x27;s alive again.</p>
<p>His muscles shift underneath a layer of skin before he opens his mouth, snores once, and then swallows a mouthful of spit while his throat and tongue move strangely.</p>
<p>&quot;Hihi!&quot; Too loud! She covers her mouth, but her giggles still slip out. Her hands and tightly pressed lips fail to mute her voice - only her self-restraint keeps them at bay.</p>
<p>&quot;I ought to let him rest longer.&quot; She mumbles to herself, purposefully shaping the syllables with her lips - a hollow pretence of human habits. &quot;Instead...&quot; She brightens with an idea and pretends to stand upright like a normal human with a finger held up into the air. &quot;Instead, I shall prepare some games!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Snore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Apologies... I will be quieter from now on.&quot;</p>
<p>Not even five minutes later, the ghost flits across the haunted house, poking her face into every cupboard, every nook and cranny of her home. Her promise completely forgotten, she complains aloud. &quot;There aren&#x27;t any toys! All the good ones burnt up together with the master bedroom!&quot;</p>
<p>She finds a nondescript ball. Though children once kicked it around, it wasn&#x27;t a proper football, as the modern game hadn&#x27;t been invented until 1863. Regardless, it deflated under centuries of neglect.</p>
<p>She finds a rope. &quot;Ropes are fun, right?&quot; No. Well, actually... Ahem, anyway, she continues her hunt for anything that they could play with - anything to convince him to stay longer: a raggedy doll from the attic, a six-sided die that fell under the kitchen counter, and a few dusty cups.</p>
<p>And a knife? &quot;Indeed. Every child likes to play with them. They oughtn&#x27;t, but they do.&quot;</p>
<p>Painstakingly, she carries every bit and piece she can find into the kitchen, where Deek still slumbers and snores.</p>
<p>While reassuring herself of his health whenever she passes by, Mary doesn&#x27;t notice the passing time - not even when the sun struggles with all its might to pierce the overcast sky. It finds a hole in the clouds; it sends a ray of light to her haunted house; through a crack in the wall, it aims straight for Deek&#x27;s closed eyes.</p>
<p>His face scrunches up. His eyelids suddenly snap open. The first thing he sees as he&#x27;s torn from his sleep is the ghastly sight of a ghostly girl panting and pulling at a hefty teapot, big enough for a house full of guests. He remembers last night&#x27;s fever dreams and juggles with the memories until they make sense: everything really happened.</p>
<p>His face scrunches up once more. &quot;No, it still doesn&#x27;t make any sense.&quot; He mutters as he pushes the smelly blanket aside. Sensible or not, the pretty ghost clearly needs his help. He sluggishly manoeuvres up to his feet and approaches. &quot;Do you need help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh!&quot; She jumps and rams her head through the ceiling before shouting her muffled screams into the wood. When she returns, she pouts sheepishly. &quot;... Ahem. I wasn&#x27;t scared. And I don&#x27;t need help. Tis just a matter of time before I can get this done.&quot;</p>
<p>The pot only hangs from the ceiling by a simple hook, yet it proves too heavy and too cumbersome for her. Over and over she tries and fails.</p>
<p>Deek grabs the nearest unoccupied kitchen chair and places it underneath the floating, struggling ghost. Standing on top of it, he picks the pot up without issues.</p>
<p>Once he&#x27;s back on the ground, Mary, with a face more translucent than usual, awaits with outstretched arms for him to pass it along.</p>
<p>... <strong>Clang</strong></p>
<p>The cast-iron kettle clatters to the floor with a loud gong, bouncing in place and denting the wood.</p>
<p>They both stare at it between their feet - and non-feet - until it lies motionless. They should have known this was bound to happen.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s where you wanted to place the pot anyway, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Mary copies his cheeky grin exactly. &quot;The floor is the proper waiting place for a teapot before I-- ahem, I mean before you can place it on the fireplace later. Just as planned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That fireplace there? On top of the wood stove?&quot;</p>
<p>She nods, looking off to the side and trying not to see it happen.</p>
<p>&quot;There we go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha--&quot; A noise not unlike a snort through the nose sounds out when she forces an end to her laughter. &quot;Apologies! That whole ordeal was just too funny! I haven&#x27;t had so much fun in ages, and we haven&#x27;t even started the games yet!&quot;</p>
<p>Her laughter, with its ups and downs in tones, sounds like an angelic hymn - ambrosia for the boy&#x27;s ears alone to savour. And like any addictive drug, he craves more, yet his mind blanks. How can he make her laugh again when she takes his breath away?</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want to play first?&quot; Her transparent blue eyes sparkle with glee. &quot;Hide and seek? Blind man&#x27;s bluff? I found a die. Or we could play knucklebones if you want!&quot;</p>
<p>Curiosity regains control, beating off the blush. &quot;Blind man&#x27;s bluff and knucklebones? I&#x27;ve never heard of those games. How do you play them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of us wears a blindfold.&quot; Mary closes her eyes and stretches out her arms as she floats around in a circle. &quot;And that person has to capture the other. The other can only walk, and he has to make noises on command, and no running allowed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you can&#x27;t wear blindfolds, can you?&quot;</p>
<p>Her index finger rises to the air as she opens her mouth in protest. &quot;Of course I can--&quot; Her sight is magical, and obstructing her eyes with mundane fabric won&#x27;t work. &quot;Ah, crud. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t even really close my eyes. Horse manure.&quot;</p>
<p>Deek snorts a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#x27;m really good at knucklebones!&quot; She picks up a couple of small bones from her pile. &quot;You throw them up, and you have to catch them while doing tricks. Watch this!&quot; She catches every one of them with the back of her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Woah!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neat, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s so cool! Woah! It&#x27;s like they are floating inside your hand!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmhm. It seems my bones like to stick to me. You know, it&#x27;s actually rather difficult to get rid of them.&quot; She weaves her hand around while the bones stay fixed in place. Only when she pinches them between her fingertips with her other hand can she pull them out and pass them over.</p>
<p>Deek stares at the pieces lying within his palm. Realisation murders his enthusiasm like Mary was murdered all those centuries ago. &quot;These are your bones?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, yes.&quot; She waves him off. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry! The witch had defiled and desecrated them already, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about mistreating them any further.&quot;</p>
<p>Another lie. She wishes her bones would find a proper resting place in the ground outside so they could find the peace she cannot. Sometimes, she imagines how she would decorate her grave. She could plant daisies all around it.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t like that game, we could play with knives instead! Just don&#x27;t leave yet... please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to leave, but that doesn&#x27;t sound very responsible, does it? Shouldn&#x27;t you be telling me not to play with knives?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Knives are fine with adult supervision. And I&#x27;m an adult!&quot; She&#x27;d died at the tender age of seventeen. &quot;Knights start their swordsmanship training much earlier - when they&#x27;re much younger than even you are.&quot; A new idea strikes her like a sword&#x27;s pommel to the face. &quot;Do you want to play with the sword? There&#x27;s a manual in the attic. You could practise the stances and forms, if you&#x27;d like!&quot;</p>
<p>Deek&#x27;s stomach growls, yet his eyes light up. &quot;Like a knight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Deal!&quot; He immediately digs carelessly through the assorted junk Mary had brought and stacked up in a pile on top of the sword. Only luck - and the dulled blade - prevents an accident. &quot;How do I use this thing?&quot;</p>
<p>His stance is terrible - the worst way possible. Despite it, he grins from ear to ear like any young knight in training would.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait here! I will bring the book!&quot;</p>
<p>Before he can utter a word in protest, she shoots away, through the air, through the ceiling, and out of earshot.</p>
<p>With a growing feeling in his stomach that he must do the heavy lifting for her - along with a pang of hunger - he takes a moment to look around the kitchen and listen to the gentle chirping birds outside.</p>
<p>The morning light defeated the eerie atmosphere of the haunted house. From a terrifying house of horrors, it has transformed into a mere run-down apartment, reminding Deek a little of his grandparents&#x27; place.</p>
<p>He doesn&#x27;t see any electrical fixtures, but his own home lacks them too. The wallpaper is terribly outdated, gaudy and caked in dust, while the dark, stained wood of the kitchen floor has clearly seen better days. However, it&#x27;s nothing like the hellhole he encountered the night before.</p>
<p>Truly - as different as night and day.</p>
<p>When his attention returns to the present, Mary is still missing as expected, so Deek leaves the sword and kitchen behind. He heads up the stairwell, past the strange door in the wall. He ignores the creepy, charred bedroom and climbs into the attic, with the ladder just barely holding on. He finds Mary bending over one of the treasure chests, tugging at a book inside with all her might.</p>
<p>An older version of Deek might have lingered on the sight a little longer. &quot;Let me help you!&quot; Like a knight in training, he rushes to the occasion to assist the maiden in distress. Naturally, she refuses, doing her utmost to prevent him from accessing the booty. Despite her struggles and protests, she cannot stop him from overpowering her and simply reaching through her buttocks to pull it out.</p>
<p>With a huff, she receives the book from him. A playful grin tugs at her lips before it grows to a mischievous smirk. &quot;Race you to the kitchen!&quot;</p>
<p>When she rushes through the floor, she accidentally leaves the book behind.</p>
<p>&quot;Hahaha!&quot; Deek has found the funniest, cutest, prettiest and nicest ghost ever, and he cannot believe he used to be afraid of her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Deek&#x27;s stomach rumbles louder than ever before in his short life. It is his noisy reminder that he&#x27;s eaten nothing but a few sweets since yesterday. Fear and excitement masked his hunger for a time, but now, in the dim light of the waning evening sun, it gnaws at him.</p>
<p>He looks at Mary floating near the ceiling, twirling absentmindedly in the middle of the dining room. In her mind, she&#x27;s already playing their next game. &quot;Mary?&quot; He calls softly, wishing not to break the delicate atmosphere that had settled between them. &quot;I think I need to go home soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary freezes mid-twirl; her smile falters in an instant. She floats down to his level, and her glowing form dims. &quot;But... we&#x27;re having so much fun, right?&quot; Her voice resounds with a deep sadness as she pleads. &quot;We haven&#x27;t even played hide-and-go-seek yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. But I&#x27;m really hungry...&quot; Deek replies, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;... Hi, Really Hungry. I&#x27;m Mary... uh, Shepherd, probably?&quot;</p>
<p>Deek doesn&#x27;t find the joke to be filling at all, and her delivery fell flat too.</p>
<p>&quot;How about an herbal tea? I think I used to drink it all the time when I was a child. It really helped keep the hunger pangs at bay, and we were planning to make tea anyway, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>The lonely teapot still stands on the cold fireplace, untouched and neglected. It yearns to be used and abused, to drown its lips in water and then burn until it screams. They team up to fulfil its dubious desires. Deek handles all the heavy lifting while Mary points out which herbs to use, where to find the cleanest puddles and driest firewood left behind almost three hundred years ago, and where Lucas dropped his knapsack with the Zippo lighter still inside.</p>
<p>A cup of fennel peppermint brew and the final bits and pieces of Lucas&#x27; sweet raid do their best to stave off his starvation for a few more hours. Then, the pair plays a few rounds of hide-and-seek.</p>
<p>But the improved mood doesn&#x27;t last. Just as the sun passes the horizon and another cluster of clouds gathers for another round of rain, Deek speaks up again. &quot;Mary? My family... they must be worried about me. And I lied about the tea. It barely helped... I&#x27;m still hungry.&quot;</p>
<p>An injured boy can&#x27;t sustain himself on an empty stomach. Exhaustion gnaws at every muscle and joint of his body. Taking it as her cue to give up the round, Mary leaves her hiding place inside the kitchen&#x27;s cutlery drawer. A sombre expression masks her face, heavy and filled to the brim with sorrow.</p>
<p>She must let him go. She cannot keep him forever.</p>
<p>&quot;In that case...&quot; But she can&#x27;t let him go. &quot;More tea helps more! Come on, just a few more hours, alright? ... I don&#x27;t want to be alone again... We still have tag to play, and I promise I won&#x27;t fly through the walls to cheat.&quot;</p>
<p>She also promised not to turn invisible earlier.</p>
<p>Deek clutches his stomach and gently checks the back of his head. &quot;Alright.&quot; He doesn&#x27;t want to see her unhappy, so he ignores it all. His parents can wait just a few more hours.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re it!&quot; Mary surprises him with a cold jab to the chest. She shouts, she laughs, and she floats through the kitchen wall to the hallway.</p>
<p>Deek runs after her on his slow, mortal feet, using the doorway like a weak creature of flesh and blood. &quot;You&#x27;re cheating!&quot; His woes and pains become easier to ignore when they play and have fun.</p>
<p>It isn&#x27;t until another two hours of running around in joy that the boy runs out of steam and braces himself. He takes heaving breaths that never seem to fill his lungs. Darkness creeps at the edges of his vision no matter where he looks. His legs burn in pain, and he stumbles every once in a while as his balance falters.</p>
<p>But he doesn&#x27;t complain. With a vague feeling of dread, he fears leaving, as if deep down he understands: the dream is over.</p>
<p>&quot;Deek? It&#x27;s starting to get pretty late.&quot;</p>
<p>The moon is their only guiding light, with clouds lingering on the horizon as if granting them just a little more time before they must resume the downpour that will blot out the skies above Albury town. The clouds cannot wait forever. Soon, darkness and the cold smothering blanket of the night will fall over them.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe... maybe you should go home. Your parents are worried, I&#x27;m sure... Or you can sleep here for one more night if you want.&quot; Her voice rises in a hopeful whisper. &quot;I can keep you safe here. And this is not such a terrible place to sleep, right?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s in surprisingly good condition for a centuries-old house - if one overlooks all the scattered signs of age. It only barely leaks, the walls still stand for now, it keeps some of the cold out, and it even has a basement and an attic! Given another hundred years, a place like this will be worth a million quid.</p>
<p>&quot;I...&quot; Deek swallows. &quot;I should go home. My mum said to be home early, and that was yesterday. I promise I will return as soon as possible!&quot;</p>
<p>Mary&#x27;s strained smile falters.</p>
<p>&quot;I could bring Lucas and Barry with me! We could all play with our toy soldiers. You can borrow mine if you want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s alright.&quot; She can barely muster a whisper. &quot;You don&#x27;t need to promise what you can&#x27;t keep. Nobody has ever returned. It was a pleasure getting to know you, Deek.&quot; She curtsies as best as she can, recalling the daylong lessons that introduced her to nobility.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean? Of course I will return!&quot;</p>
<p>She forces another smile on her face. &quot;Of course...&quot; She glides down to hug him. The boy&#x27;s arms barely hover around her; hers wrap around him just as lightly. She teases. &quot;You ought to leave before the evil monster forces you to stay forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, where is that evil monster?&quot; In the basement. &quot;I can only see the nicest ghost in the whole world.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary wants to cry, but she mustn&#x27;t. Instead, she allows the boy to go. She floats ahead, unwilling to watch him leave. Through the kitchen, past her bony remains, past the painting of her in-laws-not-to-be, past the stairwell - until she passes the scribbles that read _Lucas was here_...</p>
<p>She doesn&#x27;t hold many pleasant feelings for her home, but watching him deface it had fuelled her pranks more than necessary. &quot;Deek? Maybe don&#x27;t bring Lucas next time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry... I didn&#x27;t know someone was still living here, or I would have stopped him.&quot;</p>
<p>She lets out a short, abrupt laugh. &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t _live_ here, you know?&quot; She blinks a few times, struggles but then manages to wink.</p>
<p>Deek chuckles with her on the porch, but the moment is short-lived: the clouds begin their spiel. A raindrop falls on his nose as distant thunder rumbles across the countryside. &quot;I guess this is goodbye? I will ask my mum if I can visit tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm.&quot; She hums, knowing that she won&#x27;t ever see him again. She can&#x27;t muster a smile. &quot;Goodbye, Deek.&quot;</p>
<p>He turns to leave. His feet land on the first step of the stairs leading down to the front garden. He takes one last look back. &quot;By the way, why did you nearly scare us to death yesterday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? Because it was fun, of course!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha, yeah. I guess yesterday was a lot of fun for one of us.&quot; He agrees, and Mary lets out another one of her precious giggles. The beautiful melody accompanies him on his way down. &quot;A shame there weren&#x27;t many treasures here, but at the very least, I will treasure the memories I made today for the rest of my life. Bye!&quot;</p>
<p>He waves his hand as his foot meets solid ground.</p>
<p>And then he stops.</p>
<p>Deek lowers his hand and inspects it closely, wondering why he held it up high in the first place. Even in the dark, he can tell how stained it is - not to mention the dusty, grimy smell.</p>
<p>He looks left and right, trying to figure out where he is but only sees unknown trees and bushes in the dark. He wipes off the gunk on his clothes without much success. They are dirtier than his hands.</p>
<p>He turns around and sees the town&#x27;s new electric streetlamp in the distance.</p>
<p>Mary&#x27;s final goodbye remains unheard as his weary feet carry him far away from the haunted house of Albury.</p>
