<p>&quot;L-let&#x27;s not go inside.&quot; A boy&#x27;s meek voice mumbles, drowned out as distant thunder rumbles. The full moon casts long shadows over the old barony mansion, its once-grand facade sagging after centuries of neglect.</p>
<p>The rotting husk of a home looms just beyond Albury town - a dingy place with little to its name but a bloody witch hunt&#x27;s stain. Three young boys loiter before the haunted house, joining the bright night&#x27;s watchful eye as they stare at withered walls.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys?&quot; A cold wind snakes up his neck, across the garden, slipping through broken panes to whistle an eerie tune. &quot;Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t go inside?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop whining, Barry. And we&#x27;ve heard you the last ten times too.&quot;</p>
<p>The youngest of the trio shrinks back as his eyes dart to the dark windows. &quot;But it looks scary, Lucas. And I swear on me mum, I saw something move up there.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas smacks his forehead, groans, and finally snaps. &quot;Just stop your endless whining! You wanted to come, didn&#x27;t you? You&#x27;ve had months to back out! But now we&#x27;ve cancelled trick-or-treat for this, and I&#x27;m not waiting another year just because you&#x27;re pissing your pants! We&#x27;re going in - tonight!&quot;</p>
<p>For tonight is Halloween. The one night of the year on which a haunted house demands to be explored.</p>
<p>&quot;Barry? How did you find this place again?&quot; The last member of the gaggle speaks up and ends their spat with a distraction. &quot;I thought for sure we had seen everything in town already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With this, Deek.&quot; Barry pulls a map from his pocket - faded black ink on stiff, brown parchment. He holds it out at arm&#x27;s length, as if fearing the ancient lines might drag him back into their shared delusion: treasures, riches, adventures await at the marked spot. &quot;Take it and keep it! It&#x27;s too creepy. It&#x27;s human skin. I swear.&quot;</p>
<p>Deek stashes the map away without another glance. Instead, his eyes stay fixed on the prize; he&#x27;s certain it&#x27;s stuffed to the brim with gemstones and gold. After all, every strange map must be a treasure map. &quot;I mean, how did you find the map?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. In my grandpa&#x27;s attic, next to all his other junk. I also found a drum, a trumpet and a violin... Wow, would you look at that? Three instruments for the three of us. Let&#x27;s go to my place and play instead. We can leave this scary house alone, alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barry.&quot; Lucas deepens his voice, trying to sound as menacing as a young boy can. &quot;The last few weeks, back at your place - when we spent whole days just gawking at that map like brainless dolts - did you already know about the instruments?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barry!&quot; A sleeping bird startles from the branches above, rustling the leaves as it flaps away in a panic. The boy flinches and retreats when his friend closes in with heavy steps. &quot;You&#x27;re telling me that we could have done that instead!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... I forgot.&quot; The boy&#x27;s eyes flit nervously, searching for something to look at other than his looming friend, only to find the imposing building once more. Its walls, patient and observant, seize the moment and scream! Perhaps it was the wind blowing through cracks? Or something worse?</p>
<p>No matter what it was, the trembling boy finds himself stuck between his friend and _it_. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think of it! I was too excited to go treasure hunting... It wasn&#x27;t supposed to be so scary. It wasn&#x27;t even supposed to be night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So what if we had to meet a bit later? Just quit being a baby.&quot; Lucas strikes Barry&#x27;s arm to hammer the demand into his friend. &quot;And stop with the whimpers. It was just a little punch. Grow up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... I am grown. I&#x27;m ten already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ten times as whiny as Deek!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! I&#x27;m not whiny at all!&quot; Deek&#x27;s voice rises to a whine.</p>
<p>Barry joins in the whinery. &quot;Me neither!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My brother would beat the both of you up just for that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, your brother&#x27;s a git.&quot; Deek snarks.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! Can&#x27;t argue with that! You know, while we were at Barry&#x27;s, the git smashed all of my bloody toy soldiers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He broke your Scots?&quot; Deek grins as he watches Lucas nod. &quot;Hey, that means my Englishmen will beat your bunch of cripples!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nu-uh! That doesn&#x27;t count!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it does! It&#x27;s... atrophy!&quot; It&#x27;s not atrophy. &quot;Like when the Germans invaded Russia in the winter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Egghead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dunce!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tosser!&quot;</p>
<p>The building lights up just before a deafening roar of thunder startles the bickering children. A few hundred metres away, a branch takes the brunt of the lightning and crashes to the ground. Tonight&#x27;s thunderstorm creeps ever closer; a curtain of rain looms on the horizon.</p>
<p>The children cover their ears and cower in fear. &quot;I didn&#x27;t cower at all.&quot; Lucas denies it and rights himself from his crouched position.</p>
<p>Deek follows his lead. &quot;Me neither. But let&#x27;s get inside before the storm drenches us proper, yes?&quot;</p>
<p>Barry&#x27;s voice trembles, too scared to keep up with their tough act. &quot;No, let&#x27;s go home instead. My mum can make supper for us. Maybe even bake a cake because we missed collecting sweets?&quot; Thinking of food, he reaches into a knapsack bound to his belt. His frayed nerves demand a distraction.</p>
<p>Deek does the same, pulling out a wrapped bar of Cadbury Flakes from his own bag. &quot;Your mum&#x27;s going to tan our hides long before that for stealing the Halloween supply. What did you get?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cadbury Crunchie. Want to trade some?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cadbury Fruit and Nut chocolate bars for me. Everyone got chocolate?&quot; Lucas notices the disappointing lack of jelly-based treats. He yearns to gnaw on his food like some rabid, filthy animal. &quot;Have you heard of Haribo yet? My brother showed it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Deek raises an eyebrow. &quot;That doesn&#x27;t sound like him, does it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the git let me have one gummy bear, just to prove how good they are, and then ate the rest in front of me. Barry, trade me one of your Crunchies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure!&quot; He spots an opportunity to delay the inevitable and thrusts out his sweets as a tribute.</p>
<p>His happy, hopeful outlook wasn&#x27;t meant to last. It tumbles into a pit of despair when lightning streaks across the horizon, illuminating the haunted house in full - its overgrown garden, crumbling stairs, and broken front door just steps ahead. Thunder rolls for a dozen seconds. The hairs on his arms stand on end. A yelp escapes his throat when a drop of water lands on his nose.</p>
<p>A silhouette disappears from the window upstairs the moment he spots it from the corners of his eyes. He&#x27;s sure he saw it. A white figure; death haunts this mansion.</p>
<p>&quot;No more dilly-dallying. Let&#x27;s go!&quot; Lucas rushes ahead only for the mouldering stairs leading up to the mansion&#x27;s front porch to break his stride when the first step breaks under his weight. Stumbling, he braces himself and lands on the putrid, slippery wood, staining his hands with mould, moss and a film of slick, smelly algae.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you should slow down a little.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas pushes himself up, wipes the disgusting mixture into his trousers, and glares at his friend. &quot;_Maybe you should slow down a little._ That&#x27;s what you sound like. Thanks for the info, Dweeb.&quot;</p>
<p>Dweeb rolls his eyes before joining Lucas. &quot;My name is Deek. Come on, Barry. Hurry up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Awe, man... Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>With a careful, wary gait, the boys skip the broken first step, every floorboard beyond groaning and threatening to crack as they sneak into the creaky mansion.</p>
<p>The entrance has been smashed into pieces as if a wild beast tore it asunder on its way in. The hallway beyond is too dark to see, pitch black like a portal to another realm.</p>
<p>Pressing ahead, Lucas battles with cobwebs hanging in place of the door. His eyes adjust to the shadows, and he spots candle wax stalactites growing underneath wall-mounted sconces. A chandelier used to hang from the ceiling, but someone stole it a long time ago.</p>
<p>A twisted face lurks on the wall, resembling a man&#x27;s frozen scream. The children panic before they see: he&#x27;s nothing but a tattered curtain and the moonlight piercing through.</p>
<p>&quot;I really don&#x27;t like this.&quot; Barry whispers, his voice barely audible over his chattering teeth. He can feel the walls watching him. Unseen eyes inspect his every move, waiting to pounce and kill the boy. To rip him apart like it did with the front door. Drag his soul off to hell, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>But nothing pounces. Yet. Instead, the storm clouds drape their long shadows over the mansion. Light fades, and dark fingers with ill intent lust upon the boys.</p>
<p>&quot;I brought the candles.&quot; Deek calmly hands them out while the last glimmers of light slowly disappear. &quot;One for you, you, and me.&quot;</p>
<p>Barry clutches onto his like his life depends on it. Still, his bones rattle, his heart races, and his legs carry him closer to his friends as he looks for familiar faces among the monsters hidden deep within the gloom.</p>
<p>He blinks. The shadows lurch; swelling in size, they swallow him whole. His eyes surrender under the brunt of total darkness. &quot;G-guys?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bollocks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You brought the lighter, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Just... be quiet. I can&#x27;t see it.&quot; Daftly, Lucas digs through his knapsack, past some sweet wrappers, until he brushes against the smooth metal surface of his brother&#x27;s brand-new lighter. Its harsh edges, purposeful shape and unpolished steel speak volumes about its quality. Its only distinguishing feature is the letters _ZIPPO_ stamped into the bottom of the cheap, folded sheet metal.</p>
<p>He pops the lid open and rolls his thumb over a rough steel wheel. Sparks rush forth from the ferrocerium rod, igniting a fuel-soaked wick. Its warm flame flickers against the shadows.</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaah!&quot; Barry jumps back. A demon lurks on the wall! As the lighter falls to the floor, he looks left and right only to see more and more!</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus Christ, Barry!&quot; Lucas&#x27; heart pulsates wildly. He snatches up the lighter; its trusty fire stayed lit. &quot;You wimp! You moron! It&#x27;s just our shadows!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sissy!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Prat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say that again!&quot; The boy grabs Barry by his shirt.</p>
<p>His wide eyes stare at the fire just inches from his face. His breath hitches. Something moves in the dark. He sees it from the corners of his eyes. &quot;B-b-b--&quot;</p>
<p>Deek pulls his friend by the shoulder. &quot;Calm down, Lucas. He was just startled. Don&#x27;t turn it into a fight, and stop being such a prat. Light my candle, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; Lucas&#x27; eyes tighten in a glare. &quot;... Alright. But he&#x27;d better not pull that stunt again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-I won&#x27;t, I swear! I&#x27;m sorry!&quot;</p>
<p>He shoots Barry one last warning before sharing his fire. With three sources of light pushing back against the encroaching darkness, the boys regain their calm and begin their hunt for treasures.</p>
<p>On the wall hangs a portrait of a noble family. The husband holds the reins of a horse. His beautiful wife stands beside him with her hands neatly folded in front of her chest. She wears a yellow ballroom dress, looking up in pride at the young man riding on top of a majestic, white steed.</p>
<p>The equestrian would be as handsome as they come. Chiselled chin, hair as blonde as straw, blue eyes like the sky behind him, and not a single hair nor stubble would be out of place. A man who was destined to become a baron or maybe even more. But his face has been singed off. An unrecognisable, dark patch of charred canvas is all that remains of his head.</p>
<p>A caption in elaborate, once-golden script states: _Baron Audley of Albury and his Family - Spring of 1640_ - the inlaid has been torn out with dust settling in its place.</p>
<p>The wallpaper surrounding the painting has peeled off. A putrid smell of mould spores tingles at Lucas&#x27; nose, but that doesn&#x27;t stop him from carving his name into the wall with a pocket knife. _Lucas was here_.</p>
<p>He shouldn&#x27;t have done that. Eyes in the dark shoot deadly glares at the back of his head. Barry sees them, but he doesn&#x27;t dare speak up.</p>
<p>On the other side of the hallway, just past the front door to the right, spiral stairs wind their way up to the third storey. Swollen with years of moisture, the steps have warped treacherously, and the once-elegant carvings on the railing now mock the family&#x27;s long-faded prestige.</p>
<p>Deek stands at the bottom; his candle lights up the centre of the spiral, reflecting off something at the very top. He speaks loud enough for Barry to startle. &quot;Let&#x27;s start exploring up there! I bet the best stuff&#x27;s in the attic.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Creaks echo up and down the stairwell as Deek&#x27;s foot falls. The flame on his candle dances happily, casting twisted shapes of demons and monsters all over the walls.</p>
<p>Another careful step, and another tread groans. He looks ahead and spots an eye peering at him from a crack in the plaster, just past the first bend of the stairs. Pitch-black pupil, pale blue iris, and pure white sclera. His legs lock up, his breath catches in his throat, his heart beats faster, he blinks...</p>
<p>The other eye blinks as well, but then it&#x27;s gone.</p>
<p>A cold hand lands on his shoulder. The pale-faced boy with wide open eyes turns his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Deek?&quot; Lucas pulls Barry along, their candles joining the shadow play. &quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;N-nothing. Just thought I saw something.&quot; His gaze returns to the crack. The same spot where he thought he saw an eye looking directly at him. With his candle as a shield, he inches closer, and the veil of shadows lifts. He reveals: nothing.</p>
<p>It was just a shallow crack in the wall. No hole, no other side, no hidden room, no bloodshot eye watching him closely promising murder and pain - nothing but more plaster. &quot;It must have been my imagination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wuss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah. Whatever.&quot; He shrugs and continues up the stairs. The other boys follow. Only Barry notices the eyeball&#x27;s return the moment the others have their backs turned.</p>
<p>Thunder rumbles as they ascend the creaking, spiralling staircase, stepping over scattered wooden debris. They pass ancient paintings by painters whose names they&#x27;ve never heard of, depicting verdant landscapes and vast vistas of farmers tending to their golden wheat crops. Another paints a view of the Port of London, its muted colours shrouded in fog.</p>
<p>Not a speck of dust covers the ships, cranes, and windmills, but the boys notice it not. Their gazes barely pass over the canvases. Who cares about some boring pictures in a house full of treasure?</p>
<p>They reach the second floor. Every room along the long and straight hallway has its doors flung open as if someone - or perhaps something? - had torn through the house in a frantic search, unconcerned with the damage left behind. In fact, one door was ripped from its frame and used as a projectile.</p>
<p>Someone or something hurled it through the hallway and into the stairwell, jamming the way up to the third floor - its edge now embedded halfway into the wall. Deek halts for just a moment to test its structural integrity. It&#x27;s firmly stuck, and the door&#x27;s face would make a decent platform once he climbs it.</p>
<p>The young and nimble boy has no problem doing exactly that. He even finds joy in the odd task. He doesn&#x27;t question why a door is stuck in the wall. Innocent as he is, he simply accepts the challenge that the house has thrown his way and overcomes it before looking down at the friends he has surpassed.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, why is this here?&quot; Deek doesn&#x27;t play along. He stands atop the door-shaped platform and tests how much weight it can take.</p>
<p>Lucas scales up and joins him, bouncing a little. &quot;Who cares?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I care.&quot; Barry whines while leveraging his leg to pull himself up at his own pace. &quot;It&#x27;s not normal. It&#x27;s creepy! Like everything else in this house.&quot;</p>
<p>As if to punctuate his statement, a silent wail sounds from one of the rooms. It was just a single, short, ghostly noise that could have been anything. Perhaps a voice? &quot;L-like that! You guys heard that, right!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must have been the wind.&quot; Deek suggests. &quot;Lucas, you didn&#x27;t tell your brother we were going to be here, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not. I didn&#x27;t tell no one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean anyone. You neither, Barry?&quot;</p>
<p>His teeth chatter in fright. &quot;N-n-no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we are alone. Nobody is trying to prank us. It&#x27;s just us and the wind, or maybe the building is settling.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-what if it&#x27;s a g-g-ghost?&quot;</p>
<p>Lightning strikes. Its flash briefly blinds the boys as thunder rattles the ramshackle building. Through their blinking eyes, they spot a figure standing motionless at the end of the second floor&#x27;s hallway, watching their every move intently.</p>
<p>It was over far too quickly. They just barely made out the shape of a person. Was it really there? If only their light could reach deeper into the corridor, they would know for sure.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway...&quot; Deek recovers first from his cower. &quot;Ghosts aren&#x27;t real. Just like Father Christmas, fairies, boggarts and brownies. Grown-ups made them up to scare you. Or maybe to get you to be nice all year.&quot;</p>
<p>Barry shakes his head. &quot;I know Father Christmas is real. Besides, why would they want to scare me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wah!&quot; - &quot;Aaaah!&quot;</p>
<p>All of a sudden Lucas pushes Barry, only keeping hold of his shoulders before the boy can tumble off the platform and down the stairwell below. &quot;Because it&#x27;s fun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! Stop! It&#x27;s not funny!&quot; They drop their candles in the kerfuffle; Lucas&#x27; falls to the door, while Barry&#x27;s travels down into the abyss. It bounces and rolls off the steps before coming to rest at the very bottom, where it continues to burn and provide light to stem against the dark tide. &quot;Let me go, you jerk!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; He pushes Barry a little further off the edge.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop it, Lucas!&quot; Deek pulls Barry back to safety. &quot;He could fall and break his neck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh. I didn&#x27;t think of that. Sorry, Barry.&quot; But the trembling boy can&#x27;t appreciate the friendly pat on his back. He&#x27;s too distracted by the loss of his source of light.</p>
<p>&quot;M-my candle...&quot; The moment he mentions it, darkness snuffs out its life... As if it awaited his attention... Barry doesn&#x27;t want it back anymore.</p>
<p>Lucas picks up his where it landed. &quot;Here. You can have mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t bother.&quot; Deek digs out a fresh one from his knapsack. &quot;I packed more than three; didn&#x27;t know how long they would last.&quot; He lights it using his own candle as the lighter, passes it along, and then they leave the odd door behind, walking up to the third floor where the staircase ends.</p>
<p>This storey is much smaller than the others. Only one room connects to the shorter corridor; something black creeps out of it, seeping through every seam around the double doors.</p>
<p>However, it&#x27;s the narrow ladder catching the boy&#x27;s attention. Up and over the staircase, it leads into the attic. &quot;Out of the way, Dweeb!&quot; Lucas pushes him aside and scrambles up.</p>
<p>Deek chases after his friend. &quot;I saw it first!&quot;</p>
<p>The boys clutch their flickering candles as they hurry up the rickety ladder, each step creaking and splintering under their weight. It shakes and groans, matching the erratic dance of the flames, until they reach the top and vanish from view. Left behind, Barry looks around in worry. &quot;G-guys...&quot; He calls out, his voice trembling. &quot;P-p-please come back...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry it up, Barry! The stuff up here is bonkers! There&#x27;s so much!&quot; Lucas&#x27; excited voice echoes from above as he stomps deeper into the cramped attic.</p>
<p>But Barry can only stare at the rickety ladder, then at the gaping abyss below. If he slips or the ladder breaks, then it will be a long and painful trip down the spiralling stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;N-no way in hell am I going up there.&quot; He talks to himself, swallows a thick lump, and resigns himself to wait alone in the dark, with nothing but his candle to accompany him, until they return. The third floor&#x27;s hallway is just as nice a place as any to sit and wait.</p>
<p><strong>Knock ... knock ... knock.</strong></p>
<p>From the darkness, just past the barrier of his candle&#x27;s glow, slow, steady knocks reach for his ears. They come from the doors: a beckoning rhythm, luring someone to open them - to uncover the monster.</p>
<p>It wants to be found.</p>
<p>&quot;Awe, man...&quot; Barry mutters under his breath, steeling his resolve before hurrying up the ladder. His legs and arms tremble even more than the unsafe structure beneath him.</p>
<p>His cowardly scramble passes the final step. He scans through the attic, ignoring the treasure chests, the suits of armour, and the obviously magical mirror on the wall. He spots flickering flames and rushes towards the nearest one.</p>
<p>&quot;There you are, Barry.&quot; Luckily, it was Deek&#x27;s light. &quot;Come help me carry this--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s a monster down there!&quot; Panicked, Barry clings to his friend, pushing and pulling at his clothes, shaking him up as they nearly tumble over the crate at Deek&#x27;s feet. &quot;Listen to me! We have to get out of here!&quot;</p>
<p>As if to deny his demand, lightning strikes once more, this time ripping into the roof and shaking the mansion up with a deafening roar of thunder. Through it all, Barry&#x27;s fear grows deeper.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop shaking me and calm down!&quot; Deek grabs Barry&#x27;s hand firmly, keeping him still before whispering. &quot;And look there. The ceiling. Do you see it? It looks like the hilt of a sword. Help me move this box so we can get it before Lucas finds it, and then we can still deal with your monster.&quot;</p>
<p>Barry tracks Deek&#x27;s pointing finger leading to the sparkling pommel of a steel sword. Its blade sticks inside the ceiling all the way to its base. It&#x27;s too high for any of the boys to reach on their own.</p>
<p>He continues to stare. &quot;We can&#x27;t let Lucas have a sword.&quot; That is the only conclusion that matters. &quot;That is more dangerous than the monster downstairs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely. Now stop talking about your imaginary monsters.&quot; Deek pats Barry&#x27;s shoulder. &quot;It was probably just an animal. Either way, we can&#x27;t leave because of the storm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Awe, man... You&#x27;re right...&quot;</p>
<p>With time pressing on their actions, the pair work together to execute their plan. Whatever it is that Lucas is doing right now won&#x27;t keep him busy forever.</p>
<p>Or maybe they have nothing to fear? Lucas is busy looking through one chest and crate after another in the back of the attic. He opens one labelled _linen_ and finds a dozen bolts of fabric inside. A housewife would be delighted about the find because she could use the sturdy fabric for clothing repair.</p>
<p>&quot;Useless.&quot; The next is a chest with rusted hinges. After using a nearby rod to wedge it open, he sees a single book inside. &quot;Secre...tum... im...morta...litatis-- Secretum Immortalitatis. Et aliis iocis. Bollocks. It&#x27;s a made-up language.&quot;</p>
<p>If one knew Latin, they might be impatient and pounce on the book, for it reads _secrets of immortality_. However, the subtitle translates to _and other jokes_.</p>
<p>Another chest bears the words _tax coffer_ in ornate metal inlay on the front. The boy realises what his finding means as soon as he spots the iron reinforcements along the edges. A real treasure chest!</p>
<p>The lock has already been busted - ripped clean off. His excitement reaches a crescendo when he lifts the lid to reveal... a decapitated human head staring back at him.</p>
<p>The head of a woman. Pale skin, eyes closed, loose, white hair. It&#x27;s his first time seeing someone dead.</p>
<p>A head in an ancient box. &quot;Curious.&quot; Lucas inches closer. He wants to poke it with his finger. Closer... Slightly closer. Close enough for his breath to stir the dishevelled hair. Just a little more...</p>
<p>Her eyes snap open. &quot;Boo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aaaah!&quot; Lucas slams the lid shut, stumbling back in fright. His scream sounds through the attic, with Barry answering his call. He scrambles away from the accursed box on all fours. &quot;A monster! Guys! A head! It moved!&quot;</p>
<p>The others rush to the scene. Deek arrives first, candle in one hand, sword in the other. Barry stalks behind, head on a swivel. He peeks into every corner and crevice before moving on, counting far too many eyes in the dark for his liking.</p>
<p>They find Lucas in a pathetic state with his butt on the ground. After closing in with their candles, they spot his wide eyes, his skin almost as pale as the head he saw, and his breaths coming erratically.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you messing with us?&quot; Deek doesn&#x27;t believe his act for a second. He&#x27;s pretending to be just as whiny as Barry, which must mean that Lucas is playing a prank on them.</p>
<p>&quot;N-no! I swear to god! Look in the box!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This one? ... Tax coffer? Wow! You found an actual treasure chest?!&quot; Deek looms over the box, his eyes filling with greed. He puts aside his sword and shield-- candle and brushes his fingers over the rusted, flaky iron reinforcements and the weathered decorations carved into the wood.</p>
<p>The most beautiful treasure chest the boy has ever seen. Also, the only one.</p>
<p>With measured motions, he flips away the flap that keeps the lid closed, then opens it up slowly. Hinges squeal, and he reveals: nothing again.</p>
<p>The box is glaringly empty. Not even a note saying, _Sorry, chump, I took all your money._ Just nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha. Ha.&quot; Deek fakes a laugh. &quot;Come on, Lucas. The prank failed. Let&#x27;s go downstairs again. Barry saw his own monster, and we&#x27;re going monster hunting now.&quot;</p>
<p>Barry offers to help Lucas up, but he just stares at the outstretched hand. The hand to help him... Barry&#x27;s hand... Is he willing to sink so low?</p>
<p>Lucas slaps the offending hand away to stand firm on his own. &quot;Ahaha, you got me... It was just a joke. Let&#x27;s head back down.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>The boys torture the groaning and trembling ladder on their descent with their combined weight. In sympathy, Barry answers with his own squeaks, while Deek almost drops his heavy sword.</p>
<p>At the back, Lucas&#x27; patience is running thin. &quot;Stop shaking, Barry!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry! I can&#x27;t help it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forget it.&quot; Lucas jumps the rest of the way, passing Barry and Deek to land on the solid floor of the third storey. He escapes the danger the wobbly boy poses to them all.</p>
<p>Deek joins him. &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t have all used the ladder at once. That thing&#x27;s already splintering; I bet it&#x27;s going to break when the next fully grown person uses it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s awfully specific.&quot; Barry mumbles as he reaches safety as well. &quot;Sorry... I just didn&#x27;t want to stay behind again.&quot; Then he looks at the ominous doors in the short corridor. &quot;Are you sure you want to go inside, Deek?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. There is nothing to fear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But t-there is no way it was just an animal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t a monster either. No matter what it was, we have to check it out.&quot; A curious mind has no other choice. &quot;And it&#x27;s not like we can leave tonight; you hear the downpour outside. Since we&#x27;re stuck, wouldn&#x27;t you rather know for sure that we&#x27;re safe?&quot;</p>
<p>All very valid reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;B-but what if we&#x27;re not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are. Even if there were a monster, then I&#x27;ve got this!&quot; Deek pats the rusted blade.</p>
<p>Barry bites his nails and watches his friend walk towards the closed portal that separates them from the creature inside. He just knows things will get worse once these doors open. Much worse. &quot;Awe, man.&quot; He resigns himself to being eaten alive.</p>
<p>Deek&#x27;s candlelight flickers over the intricate doors, illuminating the Albury coat of arms and its immediate surroundings. &quot;What is that stuff?&quot; A black substance creeps out at every seam: coating the floor, the walls, the ceiling... especially the ceiling. &quot;Is that... soot?&quot;</p>
<p>He swipes a finger over the wall to inspect it. The dust stains his fingertip and spreads to his thumb when he rubs it between them. He licks it.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t lick it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just soot. Don&#x27;t worry, Barry.&quot; It has a bitter and unpleasant taste like the burnt parts of toast. The hints of metal remind him of his father&#x27;s old tobacco pipe. He spits it out again. &quot;Yuck. Definitely soot. Let&#x27;s go inside! ... Lucas, you lead the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why me?&quot; He asks but still does it. His hand meets the doorknob.</p>
<p>&quot;Because both of my hands are full.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then just give me the sword.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way, it&#x27;s mine. Find your own treasure.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas rolls his eyes and twists the knob. Something pulls the doors open. &quot;... I didn&#x27;t do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t do what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t open the bloody doors! I swear, I just twisted the knob! They opened on their own!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-it w-was the g-g-ghost!&quot; Barry finds the only rational conclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no ghost. Lucas, stop messing with Barry. He&#x27;s going to wet his pants at this rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas can&#x27;t help but laugh out loud. A tiny part of his mind still remembers the odd event that was just moments ago, but the majority of his brain is preoccupied with the righteous goal of scaring Barry further. &quot;It was the ghost, for sure. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t look like there is anyone else in this room, right? So it must have been the ghost.&quot;</p>
<p>Indeed. The boys stare at an empty room. A few pieces of random metal lie scattered on the floor. A blackened candelabra, some assorted drawer handles, nails, and clothes buttons. Four butt plug-shaped objects with screws on the flat end; they used to be the ornamental tips of the master bed&#x27;s posts. A few hinges, belt buckles, and curtain rings.</p>
<p>Everything lies on top, or partially submerged, in a layer of ashes. Everything organic inside the room has been scorched to oblivion. The floor, roof and walls have become cracked charcoal.</p>
<p>Lucas strolls inside like he owns the place and picks up one of the bedpost ornaments. &quot;That will do.&quot; It&#x27;s a solid piece of iron. He deems it to have an optimal shape and heft for throwing after measuring it in his hand for a bit.</p>
<p>Barry lingers by the entryway and only peeks inside. His pupils dilate; panic paints itself across his face. He scans every detail their candlelight reveals while ignoring the occasional imaginary eye blinking back at him from the edges of his sight. &quot;D-Deek? W-where is the animal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The animal. You said it must have been an animal that made the noise. Where is the animal, Deek!?&quot;</p>
<p>There is nothing else inside. Ashes. Bits of useless metal. A couple of blackened teeth and bones that fractured under intense heat. The windows had been locked from the inside, and the door was closed until the boys entered.</p>
<p>&quot;Calm down. Maybe you were just imagining things. Or the building settled. They do that on cold nights like tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>Shaking his head vehemently in denial, Barry doesn&#x27;t buy it at all.</p>
<p>Even Lucas has become a victim of doubt. He knows what he saw. Maybe someone else is here with them, messing with them. &quot;... Did my brother follow us?&quot; But then how would he make him see things that aren&#x27;t real?</p>
<p>After a few more lightning strikes, the boys are already done. They&#x27;ve quickly wrung all the entertainment they can from the mysterious chamber; the impossibility of a single burnt-down room in an otherwise intact mansion simply doesn&#x27;t hold their interest.</p>
<p>The gaggle of prepubescents leave, return to the staircase, and slowly creep down. Nothing attacks, but it keeps watching. Effortlessly, they move past the obstacle on the stairs and stare down the hallway on the second floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s split up so we can check the rooms faster.&quot; Lucas sees the silhouettes of open doors in the darkness and jumps at the opportunity.</p>
<p>Barry pales at the suggestion, and Deek argues against it. &quot;Maybe we shouldn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a safe decision to split up. What if we get in an accident?&quot;</p>
<p>Barry nods along as if his life depends on it. Perhaps it does? But that only causes a glint to flicker in Lucas&#x27; eyes. &quot;Come on, Deek. It will be funny.&quot; He&#x27;s not even trying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Deek pretends to have heard a decent argument. &quot;Maybe you&#x27;re right. There are no monsters, and none of us are dolts, so what&#x27;s the worst that could happen?&quot;</p>
<p>They don&#x27;t see the monster watching from the shadows, its eyes shimmering with an immortal patience as it stares at the oblivious dolts. It has waited long enough for fresh prey to wander into its clutches. It can wait a little longer until they are all alone and ready.</p>
<p>Lucas nods. &quot;Nothing can happen, and you aren&#x27;t a wuss, right?&quot;</p>
<p>The monster&#x27;s smile reveals its teeth. A flicker of light hits it just right, so the boys see it from the corners of their eyes. All of them turn to look... But they find nothing. Yet another trick of the light.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright. We&#x27;re splitting up. I&#x27;m taking the weird room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great! I&#x27;m taking the other one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Which is the weird one?&quot; Barry asks but receives no reply. The other boys walk off, leaving him alone again. &quot;B-b-bollocks.&quot;</p>
<p>The weird one misses its door. To enter, Deek steps over one half of a bedside table. Troubled by the sword&#x27;s heavy weight, he leans it against the wall to put his full attention on the plundering.</p>
<p>All things considered, it used to be a regular bedroom, except everything has been broken and destroyed. The other half of the bedside table lies on its side where it was supposed to stand. The bed frame has been cleanly cleaved through the middle, while the mattress slumps against the wall on the opposite side of the room.</p>
<p>Drawers have been yanked from their wardrobes, their contents strewn all over the floor. An intricate white ballroom dress, adorned with colourful floral stitching, bears a singed hole right where a human heart would be.</p>
<p>Barry screams, but Deek ignores the expected reoccurrence and continues searching for valuables in the pile of clothes. After looking over his shoulder and making sure none of his friends are nearby, he snatches up a pair of white lace panties and stuffs them deep into his pocket while a blush creeps onto his face.</p>
<p>Hoping to find jewellery, coins, or any treasure really, he continues to dig through the wrecked furniture. But every single valuable item has been stolen already. The sword might very well be the only treasure left behind because of how well it was hidden. Only a curious boy with the light shining just right would have ever found it up there.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sword tips over and crashes to the ground. Its hilt knocks against the wood right behind Deek. &quot;Blimey!&quot; The noise jolts him into the air.</p>
<p>A few moments later Barry sneaks up, peeking his head around the corner and spotting Deek trying to catch his breath. &quot;I-I&#x27;m done with my room... Can we stop?&quot; He never left the hallway.</p>
<p>Deek takes a deep lungful of air. His chest expands, and then he breathes it out with the word, &quot;Sure.&quot; There is nothing amazing left in this room anyway, he figures as he steps over the broken furniture once more, candle clutched in both hands to lead his way. &quot;Let&#x27;s go get Lucas.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy in question has his own troubles. &quot;Ahhh! Bloody head!&quot; He screams, equal parts anger and fear clear in his voice. &quot;God&#x27;s bloody bollocks!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you alright, Lucas?! Did you hurt yourself?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; Lucas comes stomping out. &quot;It was that bloody head again! God damn it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn&#x27;t put the Lord&#x27;s name in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;D-don&#x27;t look at me. I didn&#x27;t say that!&quot;</p>
<p>Deek shrugs his shoulders. &quot;Well, me neither. It was a girl&#x27;s voice.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas sets his sights on Barry. &quot;You prick! How are you doing that? How are you messing with me, you little shite!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-I-I--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;_I-I-I_ - Stop stuttering!&quot; He hovers over the boy, gripping him by the shoulders. Barry shrinks into himself. His friends have turned on him. He just wants to go home. And he really didn&#x27;t say anything!</p>
<p><strong>&quot;BARRY! I AM GOING TO KILL YOU, BARRY! IT WILL BE FUN, BAAARRY!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>A deafening roar shakes the whole building. It sounds like Lucas, but not quite. It&#x27;s a demonic mockery of his voice, a twisted, malformed version of it.</p>
<p>As the echo fades, sobs rise in its place. Barry has had enough. Pitch-black tears flow freely down his face. His chest heaves as he snivels, and his arm covers his eyes. &quot;I want to go home!&quot; He wants to shout at the top of his lungs, but only incoherent wailing comes out.</p>
<p>&quot;L-L-Lucas, it came from downstairs...&quot; Deek mutters, his voice broken and chopped. His skin pales, and his eyes frantically dart all over the place, searching for his sword. As soon as he remembers where he left it, he runs back to pick it up.</p>
<p>&quot;W-what the hell was that!?&quot; Lucas can&#x27;t deny it anymore. Terror has picked at his heart and broken inside. The head he keeps seeing, the darkness all around them, the thunderstorm outside that cuts off their escape... the monster downstairs. Fear takes control.</p>
<p>Barry slumps to the ground like a sack of potatoes as soon as Lucas releases his shoulders.</p>
<p>Deek returns. Emboldened by his weapon, he lets his curiosity take over. &quot;Should we look at what it was?&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lucas digs through his knapsack and takes out his brother&#x27;s pocket knife, and he pats down his trouser pocket, ensuring the bed ornament is tucked, ready for throwing. The source of his fear waits downstairs. &quot;Yes. Let&#x27;s find out who&#x27;s messing with us. Barry, wait here or come with us. I don&#x27;t care. Just don&#x27;t get in our way anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas&#x27; knuckles whiten, a death grip on the knife&#x27;s hilt as he marches off with Deek following closely behind.</p>
<p>Barry looks up at his departing friends. The terrifying voice haunts his mind, echoing around, twisting more and more as his faulty memories keep repeating the hateful words. What if it comes and hunts him?</p>
<p>Summoning every ounce of courage he can muster, he struggles to rise and wipes away the tears. Legs trembling with every step, he slinks after them down the dark stairs.</p>
<hr />
<p>They find no changes to the stairs. Nothing new in the hallway either. The house is quiet once more, their only companions being the constant noise of rain pelting the porch and windowpanes, the occasional rumbling of thunder, and Barry&#x27;s chattering teeth.</p>
<p>The boys move as a single unit. Barry wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way, but he still keeps as far away from Lucas as he can.</p>
<p>In his mind, thoughts spiral deeper and closer to insanity. The demonic voice sounds closer, ever more similar to the real Lucas. His possibly demonic friend silently walks right next to Deek. His legs tremble. Is it still his friend, or is something else wearing his skin?</p>
<p>&quot;Could you stop?&quot; The creature born of his mind demands it with eyes promising pain. &quot;You&#x27;re annoying. I can&#x27;t hear the monster with all the noise you&#x27;re making.&quot;</p>
<p>Barry clenches his jaw as tight as he can as he follows them through the darkness.</p>
<p>On the first floor, they take the first door on their left. Once, this room had been a lavish dining hall with a modest kitchenette - nothing grand, but far from humble. However, now it has become nothing but an insult to the house&#x27;s former occupants.</p>
<p>Their dim candlelight barely touches the ruined luxury surrounding them: torn tapestries hanging in disgrace, elaborate ceiling carvings defaced by deep scratches, and shattered vases littering the floor like forgotten relics. Closer, halfway bathed in light, stands a large, imposing dining table with a dozen chairs around it. And...</p>
<p>&quot;Is that a person?&quot; Deek asks when his candle highlights the silhouette of a human. Yes, he&#x27;s sure of it. The shape is too unmistakable. A person sits at the head of the table. &quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>It won&#x27;t move. Its limbs remain completely still, not muttering a word. Waiting, perhaps?</p>
<p>The boys linger in the entryway; the unknown is an invisible wall. The shadow beckons them, daring their curious minds to pierce it.</p>
<p>Lucas is the first to inch forward. Just a little. &quot;Hey, you! Answer us!&quot; But the silhouette won&#x27;t reply. What if it&#x27;s not a person at all, and now the boys look stupid?</p>
<p>Deek creeps even closer. Passing his friend, he holds his candle out like a shield as far from his body as he can. He illuminates the lurking creature: &quot;A skeleton?&quot; Intrigue - a moment of relief - seduces Deek to approach. Someone died in that chair, yet his head has not fallen limp. It was forced to be held high even centuries after his death.</p>
<p>Someone decided he shouldn&#x27;t get another moment of rest. &quot;But why? And how?&quot; Deek must know. Curiosity drives him on, his boots kicking some random debris on his way.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lucas splits off and explores the kitchen. He, too, is stumped for an answer when he spots and inspects a large cast-iron cauldron set into the floor.</p>
<p>Some dastardly creature ripped out the floorboards with the strength of a bear, revealing the stones of a basement&#x27;s ceiling underneath. A hot fire singed the edges of the hole.</p>
<p>The rest of the kitchen seems normal enough. Cabinets and cupboards cover the wall, pots and pans hang from the ceiling, and a wood-burning stove stands nestled into the centre of it all. Lucas&#x27; family has a similar one at home. Overall, nothing out of the ordinary, except for the stereotypical witch&#x27;s cooking pot plopped down between the dining table and the kitchenette.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the only part of the kitchen that doesn&#x27;t fit in with the rest, so Lucas examines it closely, finding a devilish-looking, rancid liquid inside. He pokes it with his fingers, drawing a string of sticky, viscous green gunk: a thick soup made from who knows what.</p>
<p>&quot;Yuck.&quot; Lucas wipes it on his clothes before turning to look at his friends. &quot;You found anything cool, Barry?&quot;</p>
<p>As expected, Barry stands motionless in the entryway. &quot;A-are you kidding me? Did you forget the m-monster already?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Oh. I did.&quot; Lucas shrugs. &quot;Deek, what about you?&quot;</p>
<p>Deek still fiddles with the skeleton. He pulls and prods, testing the strength of a couple of leather straps that keep his arms, legs and head locked in place, bound to the chair. Time, moisture, mould, deterioration, rusted buckles: they have loosened the bindings enough for Deek to tear them apart on his own with some effort.</p>
<p>He also picks out a pair of weird-looking clamps lying in the skeleton&#x27;s lap. They are medical devices that would be inserted between a patient&#x27;s eyelids to force them open.</p>
<p>A man, tortured to death and left to rot. Flesh stripped away by insects in mere years, yet his bones, bound by dried sinew, have sat in this chair for centuries.</p>
<p>Deek removes the final leather strap, allowing the skeleton to collapse under its own weight. First the head tips forward, then the rest of the body follows. As if falling asleep, he falls to the table, marking his first moment of rest in almost three hundred years.</p>
<p>&quot;Terrible, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmh.&quot; Deek agrees. &quot;What happened to him?&quot; He was too distracted with the skeleton stealing all of his attention - too intrigued to notice that the voice had no source.</p>
<p>Then his mind catches up. His skin pales as he turns to look for the speaker. He has heard that gentle voice before - smooth as honey and soft as balm. The same voice that lectured Lucas for his cursing.</p>
<p>He puts it together and grins. This must be who&#x27;s messing with them! He concludes someone followed them into the house and pokes fun at their expense, because he knows ghosts aren&#x27;t real, monsters aren&#x27;t real, and demons certainly don&#x27;t exist either.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?! Show yourself!&quot; He shouts, with bravado and excitement bleeding into his voice as he faces his nightmares head-on. But the friends who didn&#x27;t hear the voice look at him as if he went bonkers. &quot;I know you&#x27;re there! Stop following us!&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps challenging a monster to reveal itself isn&#x27;t the wisest choice? Sometimes, it&#x27;s best to let things be and to run away instead. Barry prepares himself to do just that.</p>
<p>&quot;Deek? Did you see it too?&quot; At first disturbed by the outburst, Lucas realises the head must have returned. He readies his knife. It must be a monster; he&#x27;s certain of it. Something tangible. Something he can fight to overcome his fears!</p>
<p>Or maybe it isn&#x27;t a monster after all? Young minds are fickle, easy to manipulate, and simple to trick.</p>
<p>Are monsters real? Or is it his git of a brother playing them for fools? &quot;Deek? Was it the god damned head again-- Huh?&quot; He stops talking when his breath condenses in the air. Then a shiver runs down his spine as the room grows colder. Much colder, like flinging open the windows on a frigid winter night.</p>
<p>Frost creeps up the windowpanes. Lightning strikes outside, lighting up the skeleton with his empty eyes and sending thunder crashing through the building. The noise, the cold, the light... the distinct feeling of an icy hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>His candle suddenly snuffs out, and Lucas drops it as he spins around, trying to swipe his assailant. There&#x27;s nothing but cold, thin air.</p>
<p>Barry snaps. Without fanfare, the coward bolts for his life: out of the room, out of the front door, and into the storm.</p>
<p>With shaking arms and legs, Deek feels the stinging cold biting at his skin. He shivers, but his limbs quake from fear alone. Only the sword trembling in his right hand and the candle held in his left keep him from following Barry out of the building in a blind panic.</p>
<p>He carries the last candle that still burns, providing precious light, warmth and safety in the deep, dark danger that they&#x27;ve got themselves into.</p>
<p>Suddenly, for no apparent reason at all, the flame dies. From one moment to the next, complete darkness traps the remaining boys in the haunted house.</p>
<p>Sounds of panic echo from the shadows. Their boots scuff on wood - they shout for each other, telling each other to - &quot;Run!&quot; - to run away as far as their legs can carry them. A yelp. The sound of a foot kicking a random piece of debris on the ground.</p>
<p>Then the heavy thud of a head knocking against the dining table.</p>
<p>&quot;Deek!?&quot; The shout of a worried friend. Lucas stands in the hallway, hands guiding him in the dark and gripping the doorframe. His eyes search for the silhouette of the exit. He finds the way out. &quot;Deek!&quot; He screams again, looking back inside the dining room.</p>
<p>Silence is all he receives in return.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll get help!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No! Come back!&quot;</p>
<p>Blood freezes in his veins. That wasn&#x27;t his friend&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p>&quot;You need to stay! Stay with your friend!&quot;</p>
<p>The order nearly makes his eyes pop out of his skull. Stay? Until the bitter end?! What did the monster do to his friend?! It&#x27;ll do it to him too if he stays! &quot;No way!&quot; One last glance - his limbs freeze. A pale, glowing figure looms in the dark, sucking Deek&#x27;s soul from his lifeless corpse! &quot;... No way.&quot; Lucas runs, promising in his heart to find help.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! You need to come back!&quot;</p>
<p>He hurries out of the house as fast as his legs can carry him. He dashes over the porch. He jumps and skips over the old stairs, and finally, he splashes and slips in a muddy puddle. And then he stops like a marionette with its strings cut.</p>
<p>Slowly, he rises up while mud drips from his body.</p>
<p>Cold rain drenches his clothes. He looks down and sees nothing. The overcast sky won&#x27;t let a single ray of moonlight through. Still, he can feel the rivulets of water streaming down his arms, the rain dripping down his dirty face, and the icy air biting at his skin.</p>
<p>Strangely, a taste of mud lingers in his mouth. His mind is exhausted. His body is tired. He rubs his eyes. &quot;How did I get here?&quot; Yet, he barely cares. &quot;I should go home.&quot;</p>
<p>Far off in the distance shines a harsh white glare. He&#x27;s seen it a few times before: the town&#x27;s new electrical streetlight, cold and unwelcoming. Nobody bothered to refuel the old oil lamps during such a terrible storm, so the mercury vapour bulb is the only light left to guide him home.</p>
<p>He remembers nothing from the past few hours. The reason for coming here, the things he saw, the boy he left behind. All of it is gone from his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell is that?&quot; He notices a butt plug-shaped metal ornament bouncing in his trousers, pulls it out, and tosses it away, never looking back at the horrors he escaped mere moments ago.</p>
<p>&quot;God damn it. I&#x27;m so in trouble.&quot; His mother gave him a curfew.</p>
