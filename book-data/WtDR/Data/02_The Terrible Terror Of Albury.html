<p>Mary Shepherd uselessly pounds and hammers her fists against an invisible wall, but no sound escapes her prison&#x27;s boundaries.</p>
<p>&quot;Come back! Your friend needs help!&quot; She screams and shouts, but Lucas cannot hear her. He just casually tosses aside a metallic object before walking away while muttering about the trouble he&#x27;s in. &quot;Help your friend! Please!&quot;</p>
<p>If she could, she would cry out at the unfairness of it all, but she lost that rather basic function when she died. All she can do is watch Lucas walk away. Her impotent struggle against this course of fate is futile; nothing she does will ever bring someone back, for she is cursed to be alone for eternity.</p>
<p>Wind and rain pass through her unobstructed. No one will come - all alone - this was her doing... this is her burden. Determined, she glides back to the mansion, slipping through the guardrails like a spectre on a mission. She has crossed the porch in a blink, heading straight for the kitchen wall, narrowly ducking to avoid one of the pans hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Mary - a creature of the night - has no issues seeing in the dark. Her eyes easily spot the unconscious body on the floor next to the dining table.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to heck. I killed a child. Please, God, don&#x27;t let it be!&quot; She folds her hands in front of her bosom to send off the quick prayer before floating over the random debris on the ground and through the chairs on the way.</p>
<p>Hovering above the corpse, she looks for any signs of life. Open eyes? Nope. Blood pooling under his head? Yes. Not good, she concludes since humans need that stuff. But his chest rises and falls slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;He breathes! He&#x27;s still alive! Oh, thank you, God!&quot; Relief washes over her ice-cold apparition like a warm summer rain.</p>
<p>After falling back, she drifts to a stop on top of a chair, where she sits and calms her frayed ghostly nerves for just a moment. However, the boy&#x27;s blood doesn&#x27;t stop flowing.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s a lot of blood...&quot; Mary might have died centuries ago, but she has not forgotten the basics of biology. &quot;Tending to the wounded... How does that work again? I need linen to staunch the bleeding, don&#x27;t I?&quot;</p>
<p>Her legs mimic the motion of standing, though there are no feet to push against the ground. With a sudden burst, she shoots up and flies through the ceiling. &quot;She kept them in the attic, didn&#x27;t she?&quot; She mumbles to herself, passing the second and third stories, floating through the opening of the attic towards her target.</p>
<p>The still-open crate is filled with the ancient, useless cloth that Lucas left behind for the next treasure hunter to find. Mary reaches inside, grabs the topmost sheet, and rushes back through the floor with it in hand.</p>
<p>... A few moments later, her head pokes back inside, her face blurry and distorted. She reaches for the fabric again, this time with extra care to avoid another mistake. The sheet flutters behind her as she rushes to the hatch. It follows her down the ladder and down the stairs, and lastly, it falls to the ground when Mary turns the final corner a little too sharply. When she looks back, she sees nothing but her pale nightgown fluttering in a constant ethereal wind. The linen is missing.</p>
<p>&quot;Bull-locks?&quot; She curses and traces her path back, picking up the fabric for a third time. &quot;What strange words the boys spoke, but better those than to carelessly take His name in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>With medical supplies in hand, she returns to her crime scene. The boy she almost killed in her irresponsible prank lies motionless on the ground. She kneels beside him, trying to comfort him to the best of her ability. Her knees sink into the floor, and his hand slips through her grasp, but it&#x27;s the intent that counts, right?</p>
<p>With the choppy motions of someone who hasn&#x27;t practised her movements in years, Mary takes the linen, folds it to the general shape of a bandage, and wraps his head for a few times.</p>
<p>Blood quickly seeps through the layers, but the pressure helps retain some of the life-giving liquid. &quot;Thank goodness.&quot; More pressure would help more; however, the ghost can&#x27;t muster the strength to tighten it properly. &quot;That should stop the bleeding soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Once again she lets herself fall backwards, sighing in exhaustion. The floorboards pass by her vision. Stone encases her until her back hits an invisible barrier, this one separating the house from the basement.</p>
<p>While lying underground, she sees nothing. The constant noise of the storm&#x27;s raindrops pelting her home cannot reach her here. Only the loudest rumblings of thunder find her hiding place underground.</p>
<p>Calm.</p>
<p>A place to find herself after the longest day in decades.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>&quot;He&#x27;s going to die, Mary.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Her body twitches in annoyance when a sound pierces her mind.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If you ever escape, hell will be waiting for you. You&#x27;re a murderer. A sinner.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The creature speaks its taunting words with a new voice. It abandoned its mimicry of Lucas, instead taking on the tone of an average older woman.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Thou shalt not kill? But you have killed. A child of all things. The most wicked punishment for all eternity awaits you. You know that, right?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps it is the voice of Mary&#x27;s mother, but the ghostly girl has forgotten what she sounded like a long time ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut your demon mouth.&quot; Her resting place has become rather uncomfortable, so she returns to the surface. &quot;Go back to sleep. Nobody is afraid of you any longer.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;But you are, aren&#x27;t you? I can taste it. You are deathly afraid. Your precious _god_ will take your soul and plunge it into damnation. The worst fate awaits you. Worse than anything the witch could have ever done to you.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Stop spreading your filthy lies, demon! The boy will live. One day, I will pass on, and then the Lord shall bring me to paradise to live with my family once more.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence follows. The fiend decides no reply is the best response.</p>
<p>Seconds pass. The storm outside is all she hears because the boy&#x27;s shallow breaths are too quiet. Each second passes with dread filling her mind. &#x27;Will the boy survive? What taunts will it spew next? How will it try to poison my mind further?&#x27;</p>
<p>It has already broken her so deeply. It stole the voices of her loved ones just to meddle with her memories until she forgot what was real and what were the creature&#x27;s lies. It threatened her with misery and damnation as punishment for every sin she ever committed. Even the small ones. It replayed the desperate screams of her final moments for months on repeat.</p>
<p>Depravity. Boundless immorality. The monster knows no limits. It will use anything to cause misery.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;You used magic and still expect to enter heaven? Pathetic.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;SHUT UP! I&#x27;m not a witch! I didn&#x27;t practise witchcraft! Stop your petty lies!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Yet your soul has been tainted by it - corrupted! Do you think he cares? You&#x27;re as bad as the lot of them! Listen to your mother when she tells you to give up!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Mary would cry, or run, or shout for help, but she can&#x27;t do any of it.</p>
<p>Help won&#x27;t reach the poor, isolated girl. Tears can&#x27;t flow from her cold, dead face. And she can never run past the boundaries of her everlasting prison. All she has are her prayers and her hopes that god can hear her pleas.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, oh Lord Almighty. Free me from this cursed unlife. I will do anything. I will save the boy. I will hunt down the wicked for You; I will be Your sword, Your shield, Your tool. Just make it end... Please...&quot;</p>
<p>She keeps her hands folded before her bosom for a little while longer.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;He can&#x27;t hear youuu.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Mary stops listening to the creature. Instead, when she looks around, she concentrates only on the boy in front of her, watching his slowly rising and falling chest, listening to his shallow breaths. &quot;I ought to get him something nice to sleep on.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;What for? He&#x27;s as good as dead.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Sensing the loss of control over the ghost, it lashes out but fails to reignite her fears. Panic made Mary malleable - allowed her to be influenced. But after finding strength in faith, her heart resolved and hardened, becoming impenetrable to the feeble attempts.</p>
<p>She floats up to the second storey, where the Audley family graciously let her sleep the weeks before her scheduled marriage. Before its destruction, the room had been far too extravagant in her opinion. Still, in the distant past, she would hover inside the wrecked room and just imagine how her life could have ended if it weren&#x27;t for the witch. But she stopped doing that once she forgot the faces of all her loved ones.</p>
<p>The first one to leave forever was her ill-fated husband-not-to-be. Every girl in the village was livid with jealousy when they found out the baron&#x27;s son was willing to marry a lowborn peasant. Or rather, they were livid because he didn&#x27;t want to marry them instead.</p>
<p>She still remembers how she lost her friendships when the young, confident and handsome man strutted into her village. That fateful day when his eyes fell on her: she thought, for sure, she was the luckiest girl in the whole world.</p>
<p>Oh, how wrong that turned out to be.</p>
<p>A few decades later, she forgot what her father looked like. In her mind, she still remembers how a faceless man flung her around and held her up high above his head when she was just a child, no older than these boys must be. She knows it must have been her father. After a long day of labour on their baron&#x27;s fields, perhaps, the man still found the strength to play with her.</p>
<p>Or was it really her father? Did it even happen? The memory is so blurry and foggy. Just how much did she make up?</p>
<p>And then she lost her dearest mother. The woman she spent most-- no, all of her mortal life with. She was there for every important step of her living existence, but despite it, she cannot recall the face or voice or anything of her beloved mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless.&quot; Mary shakes her head and rids herself of the depression that sneaked up at the sight of the room. &quot;I came to fetch my mattress. I ought to remember that at the very least.&quot;</p>
<p>Easier said than done. She herself might not have any issues moving between places in her haunted house, but carrying things is an entirely different story. Small and light items, like a sheet of fabric, are of no concern for the ghost, but a mattress stuffed to the brim with duck-down feathers becomes an insufferable nightmare for her.</p>
<p>When she lifts it, the weight proves too heavy, and it falls through Mary&#x27;s body. Every time it snags on anything, the mattress slips out of her hold, and she has to pick it up again. Like when it gets stuck on the broken bedside table or when the corner catches on the doorframe.</p>
<p>The only effortless part is carrying it down the stairs. She simply pushes it off and watches it tumble all the way down. She celebrates briefly after exerting the Herculean effort to transport the mattress around five to six metres. But her pride doesn&#x27;t last long. She greases her ghostly elbows and drags the mattress the final stretch, and--</p>
<p>&quot;... They are in the way.&quot; She mutters while staring at the _random debris_ on the ground. Her pieces lie strewn all around the boy&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>&quot;My bones...&quot; She cannot ignore them any longer. The fragments of her old body. Broken, shattered, some sliced as if by a sharp blade.</p>
<p>Unlike the remains of her former fiancé, hers really didn&#x27;t age quite as gracefully, and now she has to either pull the boy&#x27;s body across her own bones or move the pieces away to place the mattress closer.</p>
<p>&quot;... I-- ... I&#x27;ve always wanted to clean up the house...&quot;</p>
<p>Gingerly, she grasps the largest piece she can find. It&#x27;s half of her left femur. As she holds it, she feels as if another piece drains from her soul. Nobody should be moving around their own corpse. Still, she does it.</p>
<p>Piece by piece, she picks one up, thinks about its place in her living body, and she ponders about the consequences for her eternal soul. Does it count as desecration when it&#x27;s her own remains? &quot;The undertaker ought to be doing this...&quot;</p>
<p>Still, she places them neatly in the corner of the room before floating back and repeating the process. That&#x27;s most of her left hand. Those shell-like fragments might make up her skull. And that&#x27;s part of her foot.</p>
<p>Over a hundred times, she repeats that process. Some phalanx bones, maybe a shard of her tibia, and a couple of vertebrae. It&#x27;s not like she actually knows the words for those bones, but she recognises them from butchering animals in the past.</p>
<p>After a few dozen repetitions, the remaining pieces are too small or too broken for her to identify them, so she stacks them in a heap. Finally, she places the mattress next to the boy and rolls him on top of it by pulling at his clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;... He&#x27;s still asleep...&quot; Unconscious, actually. &quot;I have an idea!&quot;</p>
<p>Mary flits towards the kitchenette and sticks her head inside cupboards at random. &quot;Where did she keep it...&quot; She ignores the bits of food that have rotted and turned to dust long ago.</p>
<p>&quot;There! I knew she would have some!&quot; She flings open the pantry, then pulls out some bone-dry twigs from the herbal storage. For centuries the dry herbs stayed untouched by mould. &quot;Lavender!&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, it is rosemary. &quot;Right. Rosemary! That&#x27;s what I meant to say.&quot; Sometimes, Mary talks with herself.</p>
<p>With rosemary ready in her hand, she returns to the unconscious boy. His bleeding has finally ebbed, and Mary places the bundled branches under his nose.</p>
<p>&quot;There! That will wake him up.&quot;</p>
<p>What she actually needs are smelling salts: ammonium carbonate. The released ammonia gases can rouse people from unconsciousness by stimulating deeply ingrained instincts to avoid suffocation.</p>
<p>&quot;Any second now.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not how it works.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Any... second... now.&quot; For the twentieth or thirtieth time, Mary has repeated the spell without any success. She knows she just has to repeat it often enough; it&#x27;ll turn true at some point... hopefully. The boy&#x27;s chest barely moves with his shallow breaths.</p>
<p>A deep sigh escapes her lips but fails to stir the air with the mimicry of a breath. Once more, she tries to hold the boy&#x27;s hand to give him a semblance of comfort - another feeling she cannot remember anymore - but her hand simply phases through his. As always, she cannot hold, embrace, or even touch a living being. The sadistic curse bars her from enjoying even the simplest of things.</p>
<p>Long ago, when flies and maggots feasted on her rotting flesh, Mary found out about this particular facet of her torture. She couldn&#x27;t stop them. To her, the tiny things were as unmovable as boulders. She used to think that was its purpose: the witch wanted to attack her undying spirit by making her watch her body decompose without any hope of defending herself from flies, rats or worms.</p>
<p>Only much later did she figure out the true reason behind it: she must never feel the warmth of another human being again. Cursed for eternity to watch; cursed to be so close, yet so far. Comfort, nurture, warmth, health, freedom, sanctity, her loved ones, her very fate - it all has been meticulously stripped away for eternity over the course of a single horrifying night.</p>
<p>Tears would be streaming down her face right now if only she could cry. Instead, she breaks through the depressing slump, as she had done countless times before. She puts on a bright smile and forces hope to take root once more.</p>
<p>&quot;Any second now.&quot; Her voice causes a stir of motion. The boy moved!</p>
<p>His hand twitches, passing effortlessly through Mary&#x27;s. His throat shifts as he swallows. His perplexed eyes flutter open, staring listlessly at nothing as he turns his head this and that way.</p>
<p>&quot;Huwah?&quot; It feels as if his mouth has been stuffed to his lips with cotton. His pupils take forever to expand, adjusting to the darkness. His mind is already busy playing tricks on him, making him briefly see a figure in the dark. Yet, he finds himself alone after arduously struggling to aimlessly crawl on the spot, getting nowhere.</p>
<p>His hands press on the soft surface of a mattress before he gives up and sits down. Alarm slowly pushes through the fog in his mind. Tonight&#x27;s details replay themselves in front of his inner eyes. He remembers how he got here, he remembers the layout of the kitchen, and he remembers where he saw that very same mattress before.</p>
<p>&quot;Lucas? Barry?&quot; He doesn&#x27;t dare to shout to be heard over the ever-present rain outside, fearing the things who might hear him.</p>
<p>Nothing replies, but he cannot say whether he&#x27;s glad about it or not as he rubs the back of his head. He feels the moistness and smells the coppery scent of blood on a loose bandage. A painful sting jolts through his whole body whenever he touches the tender spot, so he stops. &quot;Guys?&quot;</p>
<p>Lightning strikes, and he spots an unlit candle lying just out of reach - right where he dropped it. Seeing it, Deek searches his pockets for anything useful. He feels a silken-soft fabric brushing his fingertips, some wrapped chocolate bars, a map made from human skin - perhaps - but nothing else.</p>
<p>Lucas has the lighter, but he&#x27;s nowhere to be seen. Deek is alone in the dark with pain all over. A tear slips through his tightly clenched eyelids, but he keeps quiet, listening to the storm raging on.</p>
<p>The bitter truth that his friends have left him behind hits him almost as hard as the smack against the table. He wants the tears to run freely, to wash away the pain and the truth, yet he refuses. His final foggy memory before tumbling to the ground teases at the front of his mind. Clarity comes and goes, but he knows: he is not alone.</p>
<p>The terror of the unknown. The hairs on his arms stand on their own. Goosebumps. The dread. A chill down his spine as if a cold breath ran down his neck. Perhaps it did? Panic.</p>
<p>He turns around, looking for the monster but sees nothing. Too dark.</p>
<p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t startle. I&#x27;m right behind you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhhhh!&quot; Deek screams at the top of his lungs as he tries to flee but stumbles. He sees a misty creature trying to capture him. He slips through the monster&#x27;s clutches and falls face-first onto the mattress, bumping his nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahhh! I am so sorry! Are you alright?! Did you hurt yourself again?!&quot; Mary&#x27;s voice, hasty and filled with panicked concern, still sounds as sweet as honey to the screaming boy.</p>
<p>He lies facedown, still screaming, smelling the stale stench of an ancient mattress when gasping for air. Slowly, a new feeling spreads through him: shame. &#x27;A girl?&#x27; The thought pierces through his jumbled head like Cupid&#x27;s arrow. &#x27;I was afraid of a lass this whole time? I need to act cool!&#x27;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s this feeling that drives him to try and impress. &quot;Aa-- Ahem.&quot; His terrified scream turns into an artificial cough; nobody would buy that feeble attempt to play it off, not even Mary. &quot;Y-yes. I&#x27;m alright.&quot;</p>
<p>He turns around and pretends to lie on his side like a normal and relaxed person but only appears tenser by doing so. &quot;How did you pull that prank off? And... uhm... where exactly are you?&quot; He supports his head with one elbow braced against the mattress and ignores the pain as he looks around himself, trying to glimpse the owner of the sweetest voice he has ever heard.</p>
<p>Even with his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he cannot spot her. &quot;Where are you?&quot; His hand slips, and he falls back to the mattress. &quot;Ouch.&quot;</p>
<p>From directly above him comes a trill of a giggle. &quot;I&#x27;m right here, silly. Can&#x27;t you see?&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment, Deek just listens to the voice. He&#x27;s content to let it caress his ears and enjoy the soothing sounds. Then, desiring to unravel the mystery, he reaches out, trying to touch the seemingly invisible person. &#x27;How is she doing that?&#x27; He thinks to himself. &#x27;She should be right there.&#x27;</p>
<p>Nothing but darkness hangs overhead, yet he touches something - an ice-cold pocket of air envelops his hand. As he waves through it, it shimmers and emits a faint glow. A hand?</p>
<p>The shining flickers appear in the vague shape of a distorted helping hand, as if someone held out theirs for Deek to hold. He grabs the curious thing only to watch his fingers slip right through. After failing again, he pulls back and shakes off the numbing cold from his digits.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going bonkers. I&#x27;m hearing voices and seeing things.&quot; Another delightful laugh graces his ears, making him smile as his sanity slips a little further.</p>
<p>&quot;You really can&#x27;t see me?&quot; Mary waves her misty, faintly glowing fingers in front of his face but stops when she spots the glaring issue at hand: it&#x27;s only her hand. &quot;Oh, crud, I am sorry. I forgot I was still concealed!&quot;</p>
<p>Slowly, as if carried on by an unseen wind, it spreads from her fingers. Like a wraith made of fog and mist, her body pieces itself together.</p>
<p>Her slender arm, her loose nighttime robe that weaves through the air on its own, her chest with her supple mounds and intricate lace designs to hide them from the world, and finally, her face becomes visible, taking shape and sculpting what must be the most beautiful girl Deek has ever seen. Like an ice sculpture crafted by the most skilled artisan of all time, he is reminded of a picture book at home full of ancient Greek statues.</p>
<p>A hauntingly pretty face that steals his breath away and kills every thought in his mind. &quot;...&quot; He doesn&#x27;t even try to mutter, knowing nothing but gibberish would come out. Just wrestling his eyes away from hers proves a formidable challenge as he fights against the pull of her pale blues - just like a Siren. His gaze travels past the enticing shapes of her breasts, past the billowing gown that hides her thighs from sight, and then to her...</p>
<p>Her body fades away near her calves. Instead of having feet, she simply fizzles into nothingness. &quot;Y-y-y--&quot; Deek tries to talk, but he cannot. The cold, the stunning beauty floating just above him, the surreality - a little bit of it all turns him into a stuttering mess.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you repeat what you said?&quot; She asks, but her mouth doesn&#x27;t move. The sounds simply appear from thin air. &quot;Are you in pain? Do you need help?&quot;</p>
<p>As if called to attention, Deek&#x27;s throbbing... pain rears its ugly head when called out. His tough act melts like a paper-thin mask in tonight&#x27;s heavy rain. Or perhaps he can&#x27;t find it in himself to lie to the angel?</p>
<p>Either way, he nods.</p>
<p>&quot;Awe, poor baby. Come here.&quot; She coos with a voice so soft and so silky that men and some women alike would fight for the right to hear it. She wraps her arms around his head, cooling the wound with her misty hands, careful not to smother the boy in her cold embrace completely.</p>
<p>He could die now, and he would be happy. Even though she feels like a frigid bath in an autumn-chilled lake, he still yearns to be even closer. He shivers. &quot;A-are you an angel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I have yet to join the Lord in his army.&quot; His disappointment is immeasurable when she floats away to let warmth return to his veins. &quot;My name is Mary, and I am a spectre. A pleasure to meet you.&quot; She curtsies.</p>
<p>&quot;A spectre?&quot; Deek has only heard of the term in stories before. &quot;You mean a ghost, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Mary waves it off. &quot;Spectre, ghost, apparition. Words keep changing over the ages, like how they changed &#x27;tax season&#x27; to &#x27;the Great Depression of 1873&#x27;.&quot; That&#x27;s not quite what tax season means. &quot;The last man who found this place taught me these new and modern words before leaving... and never returning... despite swearing he would...&quot;</p>
<p>She stares off into space for a moment before snapping back and floating down to his face. &quot;Howbeit, now that you are here, you can teach me new words! Oh, please do!&quot; Her desperate plea masks the unspoken truth - she would settle for anything to stave off the soul-crushing boredom.</p>
<p>Catching himself after Mary practically tumbled over him, Deek nods, all too eager to talk with her. &quot;You&#x27;re talking about the Long Depression. Mister Harlow - my history teacher - would smack Lucas&#x27; fingers for getting the numbers wrong, so I made sure to remember the dates exactly. It started in 1873 and lasted until 1896. We had a new Great Depression more recently, from 1929 to 1933... Mary, when did you have this most recent visitor?&quot;</p>
<p>If she could, nervous sweat would be rolling down her forehead. &quot;Ahhhaha... I don&#x27;t know... My memory has never been the greatest when it comes to numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>A blatant lie. It was the wildfowl season of 1886. The 7th of October, to be specific; that same day a royal Spanish decree abolished slavery in Cuba. Fifty long years and twenty-four days of uninterrupted, solitary torture. Since it&#x27;s past midnight, twenty-five days, actually.</p>
<p>Mary hates forgetting things. &quot;Let&#x27;s not dwell on that! Do you have any news? Is Queen Victoria doing alright? Have you heard anything about that brewing &#x27;great war&#x27;? What was that thing you used to light the candles? Hairy-bow? Cat-bury chocolate? What are those?&quot;</p>
<p>With each question, she hovers a bit closer to the boy. Excitement bubbles to the surface - to learn something new and interact with another human - it shows itself with a bright face that almost glows as radiantly as her beauty shines.</p>
<p>The boy, with his only source of light right in front of him, can&#x27;t help but stare deeply... So deeply in fact, that he didn&#x27;t hear the questions at all. He can only watch her and think, &#x27;How were we ever afraid of such a pretty girl?&#x27;</p>
<p>At the end of her barrage, her doll-like, unmoving, and flawless face hovers right in front of his, silently waiting for a response.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;H-hi. M-my name is Deek.&quot;</p>
