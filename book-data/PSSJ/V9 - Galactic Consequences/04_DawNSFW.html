<p>Some steam escaped through the sauna&#x27;s milky glass door, reaching all the way here to fog up the windows. The wooden sauna is unisex, but the changing rooms aren&#x27;t.</p>
<p>As the only guy in our group, this means I&#x27;m completely alone with two predatory pokemon while trying to undress. Maybe three... Riolu has also developed a set of wandering eyes, tracing my every move as I slip out of my pants.</p>
<p>Sewaddle... I won&#x27;t accept the fact that she&#x27;s staring. Whether she does or doesn&#x27;t stare, either way, I choose to believe she does not.</p>
<p>Lastly, &quot;Are you still there, Banette?&quot; She doesn&#x27;t reply, but that doesn&#x27;t mean she&#x27;s missing. She just never really wants to talk to me.</p>
<p>Salandit suddenly runs up and steals my towel just after I removed my underwear. Good thing I came prepared with a second-- Lopunny stole my second towel.</p>
<p>&quot;Good thing I came prepared with a third towel.&quot; I say aloud, closing my eyes. I turn around and look just to see: nothing but a strange shadow. It didn&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>Life has gotten strange enough lately that it was worth a try.</p>
<p>After staring at the shadow for a few moments, her form turns from a blotch of darkness to a silhouette in the shape of Banette. <em>&quot;She used to bathe with me.&quot;</em> Her voice makes me cringe. It feels as if a worm slithers through my ear for every word she speaks. <em>&quot;Mary took me with her everywhere. Even though it would always soak my stuffing, I still miss it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Why--&quot; No, I need to choose my words carefully. She never speaks with me. I don&#x27;t need to ask why Mary gave her away. It&#x27;s likely that Nina saw her doll form and just had to have it. Rupert and his terrible wife mustn&#x27;t have given Mary a choice. &quot;I need to know: back in the mansion, was it you who showed me the past?&quot;</p>
<p>Banette rises from her own shadow, forming in a fog-choked corner of the room. Her zipper mouth twists into a deranged smile - only she&#x27;s upside-down. Blood-red eyes burn with something beyond creepiness: a hollow, aching sadness that cuts deep into the soul. A silent, desperate plea for help.</p>
<p>Every moment I stare into her eyes, it feels like I become lonelier and lonelier, as if my friends and everyone else faded from the world, leaving me in a suffocating darkness with no hope and only despair.</p>
<p>Then, I&#x27;m back at the mansion, looking at the ruined building from the outside.</p>
<p>A zipper zips across the night sky, tearing it apart. The moon turns red, and a slit pupil appears within before a second blood moon opens up like an opening eyelid.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Nothing you saw that day was an illusion. Do you feel it?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Mary suddenly appears in front of me. Her head is back on her shoulders, but her eyes are vacant - not just lifeless, but soulless.</p>
<p>When I reach for her, she holds her hands out for me to hold, yet my fingers simply slip right through. I think I understand what she&#x27;s showing me. This creepy, unsettling illusion isn&#x27;t real. None of this feels real.</p>
<p>Mary was real. All of them were. Every sense told me so. &quot;So Mary was a ghost then?&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;A ghost. A memory. Maybe more. I don&#x27;t really know. But I know she&#x27;s still out there. I can feel it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Then the zipper yawns wide open. Like a mouth stretching from horizon to horizon, it swallows everything whole. I&#x27;m back in the changing room.</p>
<p><em>&quot;You can have my towel.&quot;</em> Banette uses Confusion and lifts it up, placing it nearby. She returns into the shadows, her voice reaching my thoughts nonetheless. <em>&quot;I will wait here for your return.&quot;</em></p>
<p>As the final word leaves her zipper lips, another uncomfortable feeling creeps up. The metaphorical worm slithers out of my ear canal, a cold feeling left behind in its wake. The molestation of my brain is over... The ghost type&#x27;s version of telepathy is awful.</p>
<p>How does Zoey deal with it? It&#x27;s just so gross and strange.</p>
<p>But this is such a personal question that I will have to ask Zoey this in private later; after all, this is a public sauna. I highly doubt I can open this glass door, leading inside the actual steam chamber, only to find it empty except for Dawn, Zoey, and their pokemon.</p>
<p>&quot;... Hey, girls. Looks like it&#x27;s only us today.&quot;</p>
<p>They both sit on wooden benches while their pokemon relax or play around with the coals and the water. Empoleon has taken up the role of a big brother to the rest of the gang, watching over them and making sure they don&#x27;t cause too much trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi.&quot; Dawn doesn&#x27;t meet my eyes. She stares straight ahead with a blush on her face and her hands pressed into her lap.</p>
<p>Zoey looks a little more relaxed, leaning back and bracing herself with her arm while her towel-covered legs are spread apart. I wish I were a midget right now. With a cool nod of her head, Zoey speaks up. &quot;Sup. What took you so long?&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps if I slipped and fell to the floor? &quot;What took me so long? Well, my pokemon decided to-- woah!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you alright? Careful, the floor can be slippery.&quot; Zoey&#x27;s drapes match her curtains. Nice.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m fine.&quot; My hands slip as I try to get up, prolonging the event.</p>
<p>After what felt way too short, Zoey rolls her eyes and closes her legs. &quot;Are you sure? Do you need a hand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nah, I&#x27;m good now.&quot; Suddenly, the floor doesn&#x27;t feel so slippery anymore, and I stand without trouble. I sit down, squeezing myself between them. Dawn clutches her towel and shifts away - only to stop short when I slip an arm around her waist.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Zoey? How is it for you when you&#x27;re talking with Mismagius?&quot;</p>
<p>She shifts before answering, leaning her head against my shoulder and placing her arm on my thigh. &quot;Same as with every other pokemon. Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s strange. I thought ghost pokemon have some kind of telepathy - and it feels very uncomfortable when Banette does it.&quot;</p>
<p>She trembles when, all of a sudden, Mismagius slides out of her shadows. Her billowing, rag-like shape clings to Zoey&#x27;s back as her wide-brimmed hat shrouds her in darkness.</p>
<p>Zoey shudders as Mismagius whispers in her ear. Her skin pales; she cringes and pulls back with a shiver. Then Mismagius retreats, floating lazily around her trainer, while sarcasm creeps into Zoey&#x27;s tone. &quot;Thank you for the reminder, Mismagius. No, I didn&#x27;t forget; I just didn&#x27;t think of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Mismagius then stops in her path, changing her gaze&#x27;s target from Zoey to me, staring deep into my eyes. Her pink irises expand, growing as her black pupils shrink in size. All of a sudden, she attacks. She dashes across the space between us and... floats straight through me.</p>
<p>When I turn around, all that&#x27;s left of her is a slightly darker shadow in the corner of the room where mischievous laughter rings out.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry about that. She just likes playing pranks.&quot; Zoey caresses my arm, but I wave her concern off. &quot;I get what you meant now. When I first met her, she used that weird power to talk to me. Horrible feeling. Scared the daylights outta me - I was just a little girl.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Dawn leans forward, peering past me to speak to Zoey directly. Her towel slips slightly. &quot;When you were little? Actually, how did you meet her? I&#x27;ve always wondered ever since pokemon school how you and Akari got your pokemon early.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could have asked at any point, Dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t want to seem nosy.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey rolls her eyes and casts a nostalgic glance toward the shadowy corner. &quot;I met Misdreavus in an old, abandoned part of our farm. The family who lived there before us left behind a few barns and coops that hadn&#x27;t seen human care in ages. Misdreavus thought it was the perfect place to live. I was exploring, and she played pranks on me.&quot;</p>
<p>New chuckles come from Mismagius&#x27; corner.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t funny; I still remember the nightmares I had because of it! Anyway, the next day, I had school - boarding school - for a month straight, so I forgot to tell my mom about it. On the ride to Snowpoint City, I remembered, but I didn&#x27;t wanna get in trouble, so I never told her, haha.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey parts the towel at her chest, first moving her stump in a futile attempt to fan herself air, then blowing instead. She didn&#x27;t let me sneak a look.</p>
<p>&quot;In the school library, I started digging through books about pokemon to figure out who scared me. One of them stuck with me. It said, all pokemon can talk - most humans just don&#x27;t know how to listen.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a rare ability. I&#x27;ve only met a handful of trainers who I know with certainty can actually pull it off. Most just keep a psychic type on their team to compensate.</p>
<p>&quot;I was still learning how to read back then, so I said everything out loud. When I got to the part about ghost pokemon and their natural abilities, Misdreavus revealed herself. Turns out she&#x27;d been reading over my shoulder the whole time - just waiting for the perfect moment to scare me.&quot;</p>
<p>Mismagius giggles again, and Zoey rolls her eyes. &quot;Yeah, hilarious for you. Anyway, Misdreavus followed me to Snowpoint City. We weren&#x27;t allowed to bring pokemon to school, so I had to smuggle her around. She refused to leave me alone too - she was having way too much fun scaring me and my friends.&quot;</p>
<p>This time, Zoey laughs out loud. &quot;Remember how Candice literally jumped into the air when you startled her, Mismagius?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Candice, the new gym leader?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s one of my best friends, actually.&quot;</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>&quot;Back to the pokemon speech thing, I lived with Misdreavus Creepythy-&quot; Ghost telepathy. &quot;- for a while; she did keep speaking to a minimum, but years later, when I was around eleven, I learned how to understand her without that power.&quot;</p>
<p>That makes things clearer. Ghost pokemon are still pokemon - I can talk to them normally, as long as our bond is strong enough. Or if I just get better at it, like Mom. Banette and I don&#x27;t have that bond yet, so she has to use that... frankly disgusting way of communicating. &quot;This explains why all those ghost trainers are so weird. I bet their pokemon are always slithering into their ears like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey shudders despite the heat.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t get it. What&#x27;s so bad about ghost pokemon&#x27;s speech?&quot; A few moments later, Dawn shudders as well. &quot;Okay. I understand. Please don&#x27;t do that again, Mismagius.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Dawn? Did you notice anything special happening to you since you became a steel monotype trainer?&quot;</p>
<p>She blinks. Her eyes dart across the room. Empoleon - water, steel. Mawile - fairy, steel. Wormadam - bug, steel. Beldum - psychic, steel. &quot;Huh.&quot; Dawn double-checks her pokemon. Steel, steel, steel, and steel. All are steel types. &quot;I&#x27;m not a monotype trainer. I just caught cute pokemon... But it does explain why I keep finding myself chewing on spoons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. I thought your insults were just getting to me. Dawn, the dummy ditz. I thought I started internalizing these things when you kept repeating them.&quot;</p>
<p>I... I do call her that too often. &quot;You&#x27;re not dumb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. But sometimes, while eating, I get distracted, and the next moment, I&#x27;m chewing on my spoon or fork.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey giggles. &quot;You&#x27;re a steel pokemon now, Dawn. It means you need to eat more iron.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha. Ha. That&#x27;s not funny. It&#x27;s concerning!&quot;</p>
<p>Fighting type trainers grow big muscles. Roark works in the mines as a side hustle. Lt. Surge literally has surge as his family name. Do these people choose these pokemon because of their personality traits, or is it the other way around? Or does it go both ways?</p>
<p>What else could we test for? Listening to metal - the music genre? &quot;Have you tried wearing more jewelry, Dawn?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not you too.&quot; She just rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m serious. You should study that - it&#x27;s technically, literally your job. Remember that you are a field researcher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We</strong> are field researchers. And I know a certain someone who likes to keep secrets instead of researching them with us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;M-me?&quot; What does she know?! &quot;I don&#x27;t keep secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don&#x27;t give me that crap. Remember how you hid that newspaper from us because it revealed the world would end quicker?&quot;</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah. It&#x27;s not exactly hard to piece things together - especially when it&#x27;s all over the news. And you still haven&#x27;t told us everything that happened down in the underground!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, Dawn.&quot; Zoey reaches across, only to have her hand swatted away. &quot;Ouch. Everyone keeps a few secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t.&quot; Dawn lies.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t, huh? Then how did you get lost on your way to Eterna City again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-well, we got lost--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so you know, I happen to know the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep. You fell while climbing and broke your ankle. It wasn&#x27;t because you were fleeing from wild pokemon.&quot;</p>
<p>She lets out a sigh. Her head falls limp, defeated, while droplets of sweat pearl down her chin. &quot;Well, then I guess you know more than I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The thing that happened to me underground is a rather uncomfortable topic. It&#x27;s embarrassing too. Honestly, just a terrible memory that I would really rather keep buried. Will it make you feel better if I tell you what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... Yes.&quot; She mumbles. &quot;Sorry for making a scene.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, du--&quot; Not dummy. &quot;Darling. The truth is...&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m about to tell them the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;The truth...&quot; It will ruin my reputation.</p>
<p>~&quot;Master...&quot; Lopunny pats my back. She and a few other pokemon have taken their spots on the bench just behind us.</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is...&quot; Last chance to backpedal!</p>
<p>&quot;Wild Dracovish are real! I saw one! Doctor Cara Liss is not a con artist! I was wrong! These pokemon are really just strange and not a fuck-up by her in a fraudulent attempt to earn her doctorate!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey turns away from me, hand over her mouth in a desperate attempt to keep the bile at bay. The snort from her nose tells me she is just about to fail.</p>
<p>Dawn slips from my hold and distances herself, sliding further away on the bench. Her mouth opens in disbelief, and her face contorts in repulsion. &quot;That&#x27;s it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was wrong. No matter how deep I bury the memory, it doesn&#x27;t change that.&quot; A tear rolls down my face - or maybe it&#x27;s just sweat from the sauna? &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. It won&#x27;t happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pah-hahaha! That&#x27;s fucking it?&quot; Zoey chortles.</p>
<p>No. &quot;Yes.&quot; Some secrets are meant to be taken to the grave. I&#x27;d rather live with the shame of being wrong than be branded as a pokefucker.</p>
<p>It could lose me almost everyone I hold dear. My mother wouldn&#x27;t approve, and my dad would be disappointed. Not to mention Dawn, Zoey, Akari, or the rest of my friends.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Dawn doesn&#x27;t look happy with the revelation. &quot;I can&#x27;t say I expected that. And it didn&#x27;t really make me happier either. Maybe ignorance is bliss.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn pulls her legs to her chest. The towel loosens at the side where she didn&#x27;t wrap it tightly enough, but her knees keep the fabric pressed to her chest, ensuring her decency.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s this really about, Dawn?&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;... I saw what you both did in the barn. Before the explosion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You saw us making out?&quot; I shake my head. &quot;Sorry. I like my secrets too much. Let me try that again. You saw Zoey masturbating on my command?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds so much lewder when said out loud.&quot; Zoey mutters to herself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dawn wraps her arms around her legs. &quot;I also saw that she was touching you. Like, down there.&quot;</p>
<p>The pieces are falling together in my mind. &quot;I think I understand what your issue is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My issue?! It&#x27;s not my fault! It&#x27;s you who&#x27;s--&quot; I ignore her indignation. I could have phrased that better.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re jealous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m not.&quot; She&#x27;s always jealous.</p>
<p>Oh! I really fucking get it now! It makes so much sense. &quot;You&#x27;re always jealous. Just because you tell yourself you aren&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not. Tell me I&#x27;m right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you&#x27;re lying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m not.&quot;</p>
<p>O M A. She&#x27;s such an unabashed liar! &quot;Come here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I don&#x27;t wanna.&quot; Nothing a quick maneuver can&#x27;t solve. &quot;Hey!&quot;</p>
<p>Grabbing her and pulling her on my lap proves almost too much for her flimsy hold on her towel. It only hangs on by a corner between her left breast and her knee. The rest of her body is entirely naked. Only the towel on my lap separates her nethers from my sex.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to make meaningful progress, don&#x27;t you?&quot; No reply. &quot;You want to make more progress than Zoey.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks at the one-armed girl sitting beside us. Zoey teases her with a knowing grin, but Dawn still refuses to reply.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t really want to sexually assault my girlfriend.&quot; Zoey raises an eyebrow, remembering how she forced me to force her to give her a hickey. &quot;So you get exactly one chance to be honest and tell me to stop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;S--&quot; She interrupts herself.</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t say stop right now, I won&#x27;t stop until you&#x27;re happy.&quot;</p>
<p>The implication lingers in the air and bounces around in her mind. One can measure how often it passes through her imagination by the growing degree of redness on her cheeks. The heat of the sauna is only a fraction of its cause.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not hearing a reply.&quot;</p>
<p>She clenches her eyes shut and presses her lips together. A clear invitation.</p>
<p>Looking her over, I note the tension in her muscles, the way she clutches her knees, and the tremble in her fingers. Gently stroking along the skin of her shoulder, her muscles steadily relax under my touch. Slowly tracing down her arm, I reach the back of her hand. I slip my fingers between hers, and the jittering ebbs.</p>
<p>Cautiously, I lift her hand away from her knees and kiss her palm. Her hand clenches into a fist. Her nail polish seems to have cracked and broken off in some places, not withstanding the humid heat very well.</p>
<p>While keeping her hand held in mine, I repeat the process on her other arm.</p>
<p>It didn&#x27;t take much teasing for her body to shiver. Her towel slips off, and Dawn gasps. &quot;S-stop...&quot; She whispers as the white fabric flows to the ground, leaving only her knees to hide her treasures away.</p>
<p>With a firm hand, I push down on her legs, revealing her mounds, ribs, stomach, navel... &quot;Too late.&quot;</p>
<p>Her almost-D-cup breasts are on display, with her pink nipples popping out for attention. She&#x27;s still growing if her mother is any indication. Her whole body quickly fills back up with tension, undoing all my progress to calm her down. Her abs strain, quivering, threatening to curl up her body like a Whirlipede.</p>
<p>My lips seek out her skin, touching her sweaty shoulder before trailing up her neck and jaw to reach her mouth. She keeps it tightly closed, but it doesn&#x27;t last long after prodding for entry.</p>
<p>Our tongues intertwine. It proves to be the distraction she needed as her body relaxes in my hold. Her muscles soften, and her limbs sag as if her tension has loosened up for the first time in days.</p>
<p>After a while, her tongue twitches. Then moves against mine. Her eyes close, and a moan vibrates in my mouth. As if pushing her shame away, she presses her palm against my chest.</p>
<p>I give her some slack, retreating until a string of saliva is all that connects our tongues. It breaks, wetting her lips for later. Her eyes flutter open, begging for more. &quot;Are you happy yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; She pouts. &quot;I want more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you now?&quot; I kiss her nose after she nods. &quot;You&#x27;re so spoiled sometimes, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes flicker with barely reined-in anger. Indignation bubbles to the surface, and she opens her mouth--</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear what I wanted from Zoey? In the barn?&quot;</p>
<p>Realization pulls her eyelids wide open. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to beg you. I have some dignity.&quot;</p>
<p>More like pride and an inflated ego... Ha. Just like me. How do I get past it? It&#x27;s not like she has the same desires and aversions I have, so I can&#x27;t apply my own thoughts onto her. No offense to pokemon coordinators, but they just aren&#x27;t the same breed of people as gym battlers.</p>
<p>Wait... This is just like a pokemon battle! I just need to figure out what she&#x27;s really thinking and how to counter her tactics!</p>
<p>Her body is mostly vulnerable and open. Despite the anger in her expression, one arm remains draped over my shoulder. Her legs press together. She sits on my right thigh, while her legs fall down between mine.</p>
<p>I could maneuver my knee between her guarded legs and force them apart.</p>
<p>Then what? She would be splayed on top of me, her legs only finding space by wrapping around my torso and her arms around my neck.</p>
<p>A perfectly intimate position.</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you looking at me like that?&quot; Her beautiful eyes fail to reveal a glimpse into her thoughts, and our bond doesn&#x27;t help either - her mind is a jumbled mess. Those are nothing but distractions.</p>
<p>She startles when I implement the first step of the plan with a few swift motions. &quot;Woah!&quot;</p>
<p>What are her weaknesses? Shame and anger. She gets flustered easily, she always tries to look perfect, and it&#x27;s like her brain starts short-circuiting whenever she gets embarrassed.</p>
<p>I roughly ruffle her hair. &quot;Hey! Stop that! You child! Take this!&quot; She ruffles my hair in return, trying to get some sort of petty revenge, even though I really don&#x27;t care so much about my hair.</p>
<p>&quot;I might be childish, but you&#x27;re childishlier.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s not a word!&quot;</p>
<p>I laugh out loud, giving her no indications about my intents before I sink my teeth into the skin of her neck, hard enough to leave a mark.</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell! Biting?!&quot; She leaves our previous game behind without another thought, biting my shoulder in retaliation while I&#x27;m content with simply suckling her skin to leave more and more marks on her body.</p>
<p>She changes tactics, resorting to scratching my back with her fingernails. It hurts like hell, but I tank the damage to finish applying my DoT: one more hickey at the top of her breast. Close enough to her sensitive nipples to break her rhythm with an undignified moan.</p>
<p>&quot;Careful with your voice, Dawn. You don&#x27;t want one of the staffers to check on us, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Her hands slap across her mouth, stifling her voice in an instant.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you imagine if someone walked in here right now?&quot; Judging by the color of her face, she can. &quot;Both of us are completely naked, and the state we&#x27;re in - with our hair like this and so many marks on our bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Mew...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The implication would be as clear as night and day. What would be your excuse? That we&#x27;re just playing around? Who would believe that?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shhh! Shut up!&quot; She hisses in a whisper. &quot;You&#x27;re going to get caught too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why would it bother me? <em>Oh no, you caught me fooling around with the prettiest girl I know.</em> Such a tragedy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W-well, someone else would be seeing your girlfriend naked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zoey already sees you naked.&quot;</p>
<p>As if just now remembering she is here with us, Dawn snaps her head to the side before her eyes widen and her face grows so intensely red that Zoey might as well have caught us in the middle of actual sex.</p>
<p>&quot;W-what if it&#x27;s a guy? I don&#x27;t want another guy seeing me...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me neither. That&#x27;s why, if you want me to shut up, beg for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, alright! Please, shut up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn&#x27;t sound like begging to me. It&#x27;s more pleading, wouldn&#x27;t you say so, Zoey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Zoey looks like a child caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Or rather with her hand somewhere underneath her towel, near her honeypot. &quot;Well, uhm... he&#x27;s right. I had to beg on my knees.&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn rolls her eyes. &quot;Please, Swole. I beg you, oh please, please, please be quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do your pokemon call you mistress, Dawn?&quot; She nods. &quot;Try saying master, and I might be more inclined to listen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zoey, would you be so kind and get one of the staff people--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright! Master, I beg you, please don&#x27;t embarrass me.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve worn her down. I grab her chin, and her face follows my lead until she looks me straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>Her skin is flushed, her breathing agitated. She must be livid and mortified right now, but this isn&#x27;t the end of the battle just yet. I need to land the finishing blow!</p>
<p>&quot;You want to be better than Zoey, don&#x27;t you?&quot; I can feel her head trying to nod, but my firm hand keeps her steady. &quot;So beg me to make you cum. Beg me to make you happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;T-that&#x27;s... I-- You want me to-to beg you for that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes remain locked on mine, seeking some other way to appease me and to get what she wants at the same time - a compromise. There won&#x27;t be one. All she sees is the hard truth: Dawn is under my control.</p>
<p>&quot;P-please.&quot; She pleads, and I shake my head. &quot;I beg you, master, p-please make me c-c-- happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I promise.&quot; As if swearing on my heart, I lay my palm flat on her breast while she takes a sharp breath. &quot;You will be very happy when I&#x27;m done with you.&quot;</p>
<p>I slide the hand down her body, tracing her contours. I feel the slightest chub over the muscles of her belly. She twitches when my path crosses her navel.</p>
<p>Her pelvis is dotted with the stubble remains of her blue hair. The skin is slightly inflamed with small reddish bumps and warm to the touch - razor burn. She must&#x27;ve shaved while we were waiting. The lonely hair nearest to her belly button is the only survivor.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like it. Or maybe I do? It&#x27;s enticing - different. It&#x27;s not entirely like smooth skin, but I can&#x27;t rake my fingers through her bush either. Like boobs, pubes come in all shapes and textures. Still, I miss her curls.</p>
<p>&quot;You can borrow my shaving cream next time, but you really don&#x27;t have to shave there.&quot; She clenches her eyes shut in a futile attempt to be anywhere but right here, right now.</p>
<p>Her skin, slickened with sweat, feels distinctly different from the wetness between her legs. It&#x27;s wetter. It&#x27;s slicker. It gives off a pleasant, subtle but intense aroma. The lizard part of my brain wants me to get closer to get a better whiff or maybe a lick. But the lizard parts of my brain are weird, so I choose not to listen.</p>
<p>My fingers slide over a nubby something - her clitoris, covered by a hood of thin skin - before parting her wet folds, seeking the entrance of her... Strange. It feels too small.</p>
<p>Her breath hitches when a finger teases the opening. There&#x27;s no way I can fit through there.</p>
<p>I break eye contact and break off our hug to take a glance... An image from the pokemon anatomy book pops up in my mind. A comparison between a human and pokemon vagina, pointing out the differences.</p>
<p>It said pokemon don&#x27;t have a hymen. In humans, it is supposed to rupture during intercourse. It seems as though it might tear if someone pushed a finger through... &quot;Have you ever masturbated before?&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes are clenched shut in concentration. She shakes her head.</p>
<p>&quot;How?!&quot; That was Zoey.</p>
<p>&quot;Just...&quot; Dawn takes a few labored breaths while I continue to massage and tease her folds. &quot;It felt weird when I touched my Litten... so I didn&#x27;t. Sorry...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you never had an orgasm before?&quot;</p>
<p>She shakes her head, and I feel the greed taking root in mine. &quot;I don&#x27;t want you to masturbate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-you don&#x27;t?&quot;</p>
<p>Sweet Arceus. Will it be my downfall again? &quot;I-- good grief.&quot; Dawn jumps a little when my stiffness grows firmer than it has ever been, threatening to tear apart the towel between us. &quot;I want control over you. I want to choose when you can cum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet Mew, that&#x27;s so hot.&quot; Zoey has stopped pretending to be an innocent onlooker and started masturbating.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it--&quot; A moan interrupts Dawn. &quot;Is it really so-ooo hot?&quot;</p>
<p>The question feels unnecessary. I can feel how much closer she got. Her legs and arms are trembling as her nails seek purchase within my skin, digging deeper by the second. Her breaths are hot and heavy. Her face is flushed red while her pussy gets wetter.</p>
<p>Just like Lopunny, the area underneath her navel shudders with the approaching climax.</p>
<p>I stop. &quot;Promise me control, and I&#x27;ll let you finish.&quot; Her legs clench around my hips. She starts grinding against my bulge until I hold her close enough to stop her movements. &quot;I promise!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say it in full. I don&#x27;t want you weaseling yourself out like you always do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;M-master! I won&#x27;t touch my Litten! I will only cum with you! I promise, master!&quot;</p>
<p>I let her go, and she resumes her feverish grinding against the towel-covered tip of my member while I rub her folds, focusing on her clit, trying not to slip inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly she erupts with squeals. She clings to my neck, trembling with pleasure, in a desperate plea as her body quakes. The towel between us soaks through, and I cum with her, sinking my teeth into her skin without a single conscious thought.</p>
<p>My vision fades, and then Dawn presses her lips against mine. Tongues dance. Then labored panting sounds through the sauna - nothing else. The coals have burned out and stopped sizzling.</p>
<p>&quot;Holy Pilo-crap. That was hotter than a porno.&quot;</p>
<p>Post-nut clarity hits like a freight train. We&#x27;ve spent so much time in here that someone is bound to come to refuel soon!</p>
<p>But... Dawn looks so pretty right now. Calm, satisfied, happy. Her eyes slowly droop closed.</p>
<p>So cute.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Goodnight, Dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Snore, mimimimi.&quot; She&#x27;s already fast asleep. She shows no reaction to the chaste kiss I plant on her forehead. It&#x27;s impressive, really; she was so tuckered out, Zoey and I could dress her up in the changing room without her waking up.</p>
<p>That was also when we found Empoleon entertaining and watching over our pokemon - the ones who weren&#x27;t interested in seeing their trainers being lewd. They left at some point to avoid the show. A hotel staff member caught me carrying a passed-out woman up the stairs; luckily she just commented about the sauna heat getting to newbies. That could have gone terribly wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight, Zoey.&quot; I brush her hair out of her face before kissing her forehead as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodnight.&quot; She returns in a whisper. &quot;By the way, how did you become so kinky? I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not normal.&quot;</p>
<p>My legs freeze mid-step on my way to my bed. Snow-themed (white) blankets and pillows await with open arms, but her question holds me back. I retort with my own. &quot;You said it was better than a porno; when did you watch one? It&#x27;s all age restricted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My sisters showed me. Now you.&quot;</p>
<p>I suck in a sharp breath through my teeth. Another secret needs to die. &quot;Remember that I told you Team Rocket abducted Dawn, and I made a sworn enemy that day?&quot; She nods. &quot;Well, I never told anyone how I got the details out of Domino.&quot;</p>
<p>And so I retell the events leading up to Dawn&#x27;s rescue.</p>
<p>Zoey yells in surprise but holds her mouth closed once she feels Dawn stir on the bed. &quot;You would have raped her?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably not. Maybe? I can&#x27;t really tell. But either way, the rush I felt back then was almost as great as a pokemon battle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm, I think I get it.&quot; She does? &quot;Yeah... I like the control when I&#x27;m in charge of my pokemon during battle. It makes me feel powerful - like a girl boss - even though I&#x27;m a cripple. But still, don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;re being a little extreme?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t like it?&quot; I probably should tone it down, shouldn&#x27;t I?</p>
<p>&quot;Well, no... I like it.&quot; She turns her head to the side as a light blush spreads on her face. &quot;It&#x27;s just not normal. I&#x27;m sure my ma would get even more mad if she found out what we did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... So it&#x27;s just another social norm.&quot; Just like pokefucking. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m on the right track with it - Lopunny and my bond is stronger than ever. &quot;We both like it, so why stop? I say, fuck everyone else&#x27;s opinions. I want you, and I want you hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey giggles. &quot;Alright. But you deal with my mom if she finds out. Now quit stalling and come to bed. I feel like cuddling tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re stalling.&quot; I change directions, and she scoots over. Her snow-themed duvet looks just as comfy as mine, and the campfire-themed girl on top of it makes hers much more inviting than my boring old bed.</p>
<p>She offers to share the blanket, but I refuse. Lopunny&#x27;s just going to sleep on top of me anyway. It&#x27;d get too warm. Zoey tries to cuddle up, but she keeps getting pushed aside. First by Lopunny, driving her away from my chest. Then by Salandit, who hisses when my arm isn&#x27;t free for her to curl up on. Riolu took the spot on my other arm, and Sewaddle sleeps on top of the pile. In the end, Zoey has to settle for holding my hand.</p>
<p>Lopunny, smug as always, leans in to whisper into my ears. ~&quot;Looks like I&#x27;m still number one.&quot;</p>
<p>Surely that&#x27;s Akari, but I still blush when I realize which aspect of our relationship she actually refers to.</p>
<p>&quot;So possessive.&quot; Zoey chuckles when she sees Lopunny bury her head in my neck. &quot;Hey Swole, I know you want to register at the gym, but let&#x27;s check out the school tomorrow first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. We can do that. Any reason?&quot; I let out a yawn.</p>
<p>She follows suit with her own suppressed yawn. &quot;I have a few top secret contacts, and they whisper you will want to be there tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh? Mysterious friends of yours?&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey smiles teasingly. I guess that solves the ever-open question of what to do tomorrow.</p>
