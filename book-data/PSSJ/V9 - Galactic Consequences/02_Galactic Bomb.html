<p><strong>Swole-POV:</strong></p>
<p>The good-morning cry of a Corvisquire, followed by the recognizable chatter of a cluckery of chickens. What an annoying way to wake up way too early. Lopunny startles awake at the same time, but she catches herself faster than me. ~&quot;Good morning, master.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a much better way to wake up. Her fingers trail up and down my chest, making circles every once in a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, Lopunny. I hope you&#x27;ve slept better than me.&quot; She nods. &quot;I&#x27;m glad.&quot;</p>
<p>Now that I&#x27;m awake, I might as well address the problem that grew... in the evening just before bed. My phone&#x27;s screen turns on when I press the button on its side. With a few flicks, I navigate to our old chat group.</p>
<p>Just me, Barry, and Lucas; all the blokes in Twinleaf Town. The chat group that has aptly been named &#x27;Retards&#x27;.</p>
<p>Before yesterday, the last activity in it was Barry asking if any of us were safe and alright... Effectively, the group had been dead ever since Lucas died.</p>
<p>Barry: &quot;Hey, Swole. Do you mind if I add Ash to the group?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#x27;m being a bitch about this, aren&#x27;t I? We&#x27;re not replacing our oldest friend with Ash, right?</p>
<p>Swole: &quot;Sure. Go ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#x27;s done and over. Lucas is dead, buried... and replaced. I keep making the same mistake over and over again; isn&#x27;t that damn shameful?</p>
<p>An older woman, in her 30s or 40s, stands in the doorway to the living room. She has deep red hair, bound up in a tight, woven ponytail.</p>
<p>Sunspots mar her face, and her arms are just slightly flabby as she reaches for the light switch. She appears as if she had been chubby some time ago but fixed that over years of working on her farm.</p>
<p>Overall, she has a very motherly appearance. The kind I wouldn&#x27;t mind Zoey looking like after 30 years.</p>
<p>When the light turns on, she startles as she spots me. &quot;Goodness, me. Good morning, Swole. I completely forgot that this is where you were sleeping. Did I wake you up with my noise?&quot;</p>
<p>I shake my head. &quot;Good morning, Mrs. Evans. I&#x27;ve been awake for a few minutes already. The birds outside were the culprits. How are you doing?&quot;</p>
<p>She fixes up her nightclothes, making sure she&#x27;s not showing any more skin than necessary. &quot;I&#x27;m doing better after a night&#x27;s sleep. Talking with your mother helped as well. Hold on.&quot;</p>
<p>After ducking into the kitchen across the hall, she returns empty-handed. &quot;Oh. I already gave your phone back.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s weirdly exposing, lying here on the sofa with only a pokemon for a blanket. At least I&#x27;m not the type of animal who sleeps shirtless. That would&#x27;ve been embarrassing.</p>
<p>&quot;I was about to make breakfast for everyone before the girls start their chores. Are you a picky eater?&quot;</p>
<p>Getting up, I reply. &quot;Not really. But I am willing to help with the chores.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, you can take over some of Zoey&#x27;s old tasks. The Piloswine in the barn need to be fed and then let outside to roam in the fields. Don&#x27;t worry about how much feed you give them; they will tell you when you&#x27;re being stingy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sure.&quot; I was actually thinking about helping her cook, but I guess this is my job now.</p>
<p>I quickly handle all of my pokemons&#x27; morning groomings before heading into the bathroom with Lopunny to get dressed and brush my teeth.</p>
<p>Salandit and Sewaddle get to stay indoors while Riolu, Lopunny, and I head outside into the dimly lighted backyard. The morning sun has yet to peek over the horizon, so it&#x27;s just the gloom in the atmosphere lighting the place up. There&#x27;s no sign of Banette. She is as distant as always and didn&#x27;t reply when called out.</p>
<p>Despite a lack of clouds, snowflakes still dance through the air, tussled up by a breeze as the stars linger in the sky. The Piloswine wool coat that Mrs. Evans lent me just before stepping outside keeps me warm and toasty enough for Lopunny to seek out my arm for warmth.</p>
<p>A fresh layer of snow crunches underneath my boots until I walk through the door leading into the cold livestock barn, replaced by loamy soil and straw.</p>
<p>The moment I enter, Piloswine and Swinub wake up all over the place; some rush to the feeding troughs while a few linger in back to inspect me closely.</p>
<p>Noticing my absolute lack of a plan, a Mamoswine - the only one in sight - steps up and points with his enormous tusks in the corner of the room where bags of feed lie ready.</p>
<p>Taking one, I step up to the first trough and fill it about halfway up. The Piloswine on the other side motions for me to keep it going until it&#x27;s filled exactly to the brim.</p>
<p>After a pause of consideration, she repeats the motion. &quot;You&#x27;re not tricking me into giving out too much food, are you?&quot;</p>
<p>She shakes her head and squeaks excuses until a threatening step forward by Lopunny prompts her to nod apologetically.</p>
<p>&quot;No worries.&quot; I give her a little extra. &quot;I would have tried it too if I were you.&quot;</p>
<p>The other pokemon receive more or less the same amount. I&#x27;m eyeballing their weight in comparison to the first Piloswine to tell how much food they need, and all of them seem happy with the rations I give out.</p>
<p>While the Piloswine are eating from the big troughs connected to their enclosures, the little Swinub are free to run around the whole barn, and they have their own individualized food bowls, each with a little nameplate on them.</p>
<p>Truffle, Snuffle, Hoglet, Chillybean and Borealis. They jump on the food as soon as they get it.</p>
<p>The rest of the bag&#x27;s contents is for Mamoswine, who then points me to the latch that will unlock the barn&#x27;s main doors, which will allow them all to go outside.</p>
<p>That was rather quick work. It&#x27;s not even 6 AM.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you guys and girls need anything else?&quot; My voice echoes through the barn, and the pokemon all shake their heads, grunting and squeaking with denials.</p>
<p>I guess there is nothing else to do. I can just get back inside and eat breakfast. Huh... Is this the kind of whimsical adventure that Barry and Ash have most of the time? Judging by what I gather from their stories, the answer is yes, but Team Rocket would be involved somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, after ruffling up Riolu&#x27;s fur for no reason, I follow our footprints back inside, put the coat back on the hanger where I got it from, and sit down for breakfast.</p>
<hr />
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>I know it&#x27;s rude to steal another cook&#x27;s kitchen, but Mrs. Evans is still busy grating potatoes. I am bored and in desperate need of a distraction before I start thinking of depressing stuff again. I won&#x27;t have enough time to spend it with training either, since it&#x27;ll just be a few more minutes at most until food is ready.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m done with the barn. Your farm pokemon are a pleasure to work with.&quot; Step one of stealing someone&#x27;s kitchen: distraction.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re done already? It&#x27;s barely been a few minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Step two: appeal to your own needs. &quot;Hmhm. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m rather good with pokemon, but now I&#x27;ve worked up quite an appetite, seeing all those happy pokemon eating their fill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, well, don&#x27;t cha worry. It will just be some fifteen minutes more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What exactly are you cooking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m making waffles, hash browns, and fried eggs. It&#x27;s just taking so long because of how many mouths I&#x27;ve gotta feed.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a good enough basis to plan my pokemons&#x27; meals around. Waffles are around 15% protein, and the plain eggs are great to get their needs mostly covered. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a lot of carbs. We&#x27;ll be busy working them off for most of today, so a well-prepared second meal might not be an option.</p>
<p>In that case, they need more protein.</p>
<p>Step three of the kitchen invasion. &quot;Have you ever heard of eggs Benedict?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t that the fancy egg on toast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct, madam. But it works on waffles as well. The sweet waffles combine with the savory egg for an incredible dish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now yer wanting me to make that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I would never expect you to do all that extra effort. However, I would gladly help out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If yer bored and want to help, just say so.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess I&#x27;m not as much of a social genius as I pretended to be. &quot;Yes. Can I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course ya can. I always like a helping hand in the kitchen. My daughters just sleep in for too long to be of any help in the mornings.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#x27;s technically still night. Still a few minutes until it&#x27;s 6 AM.</p>
<p>As soon as my hands have something to do, it&#x27;s like the urge to think is pushed out of my mind. It&#x27;s just me, Mrs. Evans, and the eggs frying up in her pan and poaching in my pot... 19 people need servings... That&#x27;s a whole lot of food. For Zoey, her mother and four siblings, Dawn, and 12 pokemon.</p>
<p>Their evolutions made a noticeable spike in our food expenses. Lopunny needs double to triple the servings now, and there are only a few pokemon left who are small enough to share their meals.</p>
<p>As the current batch of eggs finishes poaching, I remove them with a perforated ladle and neatly place them on top of the waffles as they come out of Mrs. Evan&#x27;s waffle maker. She adds a shaving of butter on top, and it melts.</p>
<p>Like this, we prepare one plate after another with nice, healthy, and nutritious foods. 19 plates are a whole lot of work...</p>
<p>~&quot;Did you remember your own?&quot; Lopunny prompts me to add one more plate to the stack.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re right. Thanks for keeping count for me, Lopunny.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;Keeping count? I just guessed.&quot; She sniffs at the food on her plate, judging it good enough to eat with a nod.</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans was a little faster with the waffles and fried eggs than I was with the poaching. She has already taken her seat at the head of the table while I still deliver plates for everyone else.</p>
<p>Speaking of everyone else, if the chatter coming from the stairs is an indicator, Dawn, Zoey, and her siblings must be awake.</p>
<p>A glance at the clock shows it&#x27;s just a little past 6.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaaawn.&quot; I recognize that yawn from Zoey. &quot;You really didn&#x27;t have to wake us up, Emily.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And let you miss out on breakfast, dearest sister? I would never be so cruel.&quot; It sounds like she did it to piss Zoey off. &quot;Ouch! Careful with your pinches, you brute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I will send my boyfriend after you instead, huh?&quot; Does she mean to beat her up? I don&#x27;t beat women.</p>
<p>Another voice speaks up. &quot;I&#x27;m sure your boyfriend would love to do that.&quot; That must have been Ruby - the sister who had been flirting with me so obviously yesterday. She said it in a teasing tone that made it clear why I would love it.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop being gross, Ruby.&quot;</p>
<p>One after another, they stroll into the kitchen as my mouth slowly falls open.</p>
<p>Five versions of Zoey, all in nothing but thin t-shirts and panties. A redheaded paradise of barely clad women. Except Penny, who has black hair, black panties, and a black crop-top shirt.</p>
<p>But still, she has almost the exact same face as Zoey.</p>
<p>Ruby strikes a pose as she sees me staring, pushing out her hips and making sure I can see everything from her foot to her waist, parts of her toned stomach, and the contours of her breasts.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop looking, Swole.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey&#x27;s mom has her head in her hands. &quot;Why are y&#x27;all dressed like that? We have visitors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I forgot.&quot; Emily grins innocently.</p>
<p>Ruby grins seductively. &quot;I didn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s my boyfriend.&quot; Zoey pinches Ruby&#x27;s arm.</p>
<p>Penny is neutral. &quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the problem with how we are dressed?&quot; Daisy is an illegal loli, so I don&#x27;t know what she looks like while wearing so little. It&#x27;s not like I looked at the scantily clad girl.</p>
<p>But if I were into definitely illegal lolis - which I am most certainly not - and I were to look, then I would see the adorable way she pulls her t-shirt down to cover herself up while pressing her legs together and scrunching up to hide herself in the crowd of women. Overall, she would be incredibly cute. Peak cuteness, in fact. But I&#x27;m not seeing any of that.</p>
<p>Dawn silently takes a seat beside me while the siblings bicker with their mom.</p>
<p>Eventually, Ruby is the only one who has to go back upstairs to get changed into something less revealing, and Zoey fights with... &quot;Hey, Lopunny. You can keep that seat, but only if you help feed Zoey instead of me.&quot; Lopunny gives up and surrenders her chair to Zoey.</p>
<p>A pokemon evolution does have its drawbacks. Not only does Lopunny eat two to three times as much as before, but she also cannot share my seat at the table anymore. Only Riolu, Salandit, and Sewaddle can still do that.</p>
<p>Oh. Lopunny didn&#x27;t give up after all. She squeezed herself between Dawn and me instead. &quot;Sorry, Dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s alright.&quot; She mutters, and a feeling suddenly tugs at my heart. It feels as if she asked for help, but when I keep staring at her, silently asking what is wrong, she just stares at her food and starts eating.</p>
<p>Looking around, I realize that whatever her issue is, now is not the right time and place to discuss it. When focusing on our bond with aura between bites, I can&#x27;t really glean anything of value either. She feels generally sad right now, but it won&#x27;t tell me what the underlying issue is.</p>
<p>&quot;Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Yes, Zoey?&quot; Turns out I was feeding her and my pokemon on autopilot, even when her mouth was still full from the previous bite. &quot;Sorry. Got distracted. Let me fix that for you.&quot; Zoey&#x27;s lips are covered in waffle syrup. At least Dawn chuckles about it.</p>
<p>I give her a kiss and a lick to get most of it off to the sounds of some amused cooing, awe-ing, and jealous humpf-ing by her sisters.</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans does her best to look away. &quot;Not at the kitchen table, please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, dear.&quot; Zoey presses her hand against my face to push me away. &quot;Let&#x27;s not do anything at the table. By the way, can you come help me with my chores later?&quot;</p>
<p>Emily looks surprised at that. &quot;You still have chores left?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have to feed our Piloswine. Mom was kind enough to reduce my share.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s so unfair! That&#x27;s all she has to do now?&quot; Ruby complains.</p>
<p>Zoey&#x27;s tone rises. &quot;Well, you didn&#x27;t lose an arm! Go lose one, then you can go skip chores too!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re just being lazy! ...&quot; And so their bickering begins. It only stopped once everyone had finished their meals, and they were the only ones left to finish eating.</p>
<p>Their mother ignored it as if it was normal, and I began to wonder if this really is a normal life with siblings.</p>
<p>&quot;Swole?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Zoey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you coming?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the barn?&quot;</p>
<p>She rolls her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I already fed the pokemon before breakfast. You can just sit back and relax, or you could come with me, and we could both train our pokemon together.&quot;</p>
<p>Her finger taps her chin in a distracted rhythm as she thinks about something. Eventually, her eyes fall on me while a smirk grows on her lips. &quot;In that case, I&#x27;d better make sure you did your chores properly. Come on, let&#x27;s go. And no slacking off either.&quot; She said this to me even though she was still in bed while I was already doing her chores.</p>
<p>Slacker. I roll my eyes. &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>She just rolls her eyes back with a smirk that looks as if she&#x27;s hiding something.</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;See? Everything is as it should be.&quot; I spread my arms to show off the many happy pokemon, none of whom seem hungry - and with the gate wide open, they&#x27;re free to leave at any time. &quot;Contrary to what you might think right now, your boyfriend can follow simple instructions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm.&quot; Zoey grunts dismissively before whispering something to Mamoswine.</p>
<p>He gives her an eye roll before nodding after some more pleading by Zoey. &quot;Mamo. Mamoswine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Piloswine?&quot; While some Piloswine start lumbering outside into the cold, one stays behind, asking what&#x27;s wrong. He gives Zoey and me looks that I can&#x27;t place.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamoswine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;P-Piloswine? Pilo! Piloswine!&quot; Now the Swinub scurry out like loaves of bread with nubby legs underneath. I really wonder what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright.&quot; Zoey claps her hands, fully satisfied with whatever she did. &quot;Now, Swole, follow me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uhh, sure.&quot;</p>
<p>She leads me past a small divider at the back of the barn to where the straw is stored. &quot;We will need to replace some of the straw in the pens after this.&quot; After what?</p>
<p>But she just rudely pushes me backward into the corner until I&#x27;m forced to take a seat on a cuboid-shaped hay bale, or rather, bench-shaped. It&#x27;s rather nice to sit on, actually.</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly.&quot; Zoey says it like that&#x27;s all the instruction I need - like I&#x27;m supposed to read her mind. She taps her foot, eyebrows drawn tight. &quot;Pull down your pants.&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? &quot;Huh?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t huh me. If we take too long, someone might come to check up on us.&quot; She begins fiddling with my belt buckle, but her one-handed approach is too pitiful to watch.</p>
<p>I help her out, taking care of the belt and slipping out of my pants. She looks at my quickly hardening member, concealed by underwear. &quot;That too.&quot;</p>
<p>Too horny to question the situation further, I follow her lead and expose myself. Zoey turns her head this way and that, even peeking over the divider. She cringes when she sees Lopunny and Riolu looking at us in barely hidden interest. &quot;Can you, like, tell them to go away for a bit?&quot;</p>
<p>But my pokemon shake their heads. Riolu is grasping for excuses. ~&quot;He needs his guards.&quot;</p>
<p>~&quot;I want to watch.&quot; Lopunny is as honest as always.</p>
<p>&quot;Mi-Mismagius.&quot; The voice comes from a suspiciously shaped shadow in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to watch too? Wait, &#x27;too&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>As a heavy silence fills the barn, a heavy weight falls off my chest. My pokemon aren&#x27;t the only ones who are freaky! &quot;Mismagius...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess it&#x27;s a little weird, but alright.&quot;</p>
<p>With an iron grip, she grabs my dick and pumps it as if it were a Miltank&#x27;s teat, grabbing me near the base and then pulling up harshly. &quot;Urgh.&quot;</p>
<p>She takes my pained groans as encouragement and picks up the pace. &quot;Does it really feel this good to you? Do you like it when I milk you dry?&quot; She whispers seductively as if she practiced the phrase.</p>
<p>&quot;Argh! Stop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow! You&#x27;re really getting into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you close?&quot;</p>
<p>I have to stop this.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on. Stop stopping me.&quot; Zoey places her stump against my chest, pushing me back. &quot;We don&#x27;t have much time; we can&#x27;t take forever.&quot;</p>
<p>How can she be so erotic but so bad at the same time?! The torture only ends when I grab her hand and pry off her fingers.</p>
<p>Immediately, I check my little one for bruises. &quot;What the fuck, Zoey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ouch, ouch. Seriously, what the fuck?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It hurt like hell!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who told you to do it like this? It felt like you were about to rip him off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn&#x27;t good enough?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough?&quot; She flinches at my incredulous stare. &quot;It felt like--!&quot; She flinched a lot, actually. Her whole body curled up in rejection. Even though she... &quot;Sorry. I&#x27;m not mad at you - just in pain!&quot; I take a deep breath. The danger to my willy has passed. No need to panic. &quot;It&#x27;s a sensitive organ, you know?&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey shakes her head, red strands slipping loose from her sleek hair as they catch rays of light sneaking through the barn wall. Another beam catches the tear forming in the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>I exhale. This isn&#x27;t the time for pettiness. I can feel her guilt through our bond - she already regrets what happened. I need to be kind now... No. Zoey feels lost, trying her best without knowing how. She needs clarity. She needs someone to show her the way. I need to step up.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to lock in. &quot;I will show you how it&#x27;s done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Ignoring her question, my fingers dance over the button of her jeans, undoing them in one smooth motion to reveal the white panties underneath. &quot;Hold on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shhh. We don&#x27;t have much time, remember?&quot; That&#x27;s a lie though. I won&#x27;t hurry this up. If there&#x27;s one thing I learned from Lopunny and Mars, it&#x27;s to keep things slow and build the pace over time.</p>
<p>I lift her onto my leg, facing me. &quot;Swole! I-- I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready for this.&quot; Zoey whispers, eyes darting anywhere except at me.</p>
<p>She seemed more than ready just moments ago - giddy, even overeager. Did she become shy now? Or does she feel like she&#x27;s let me down? &quot;Look at me.&quot;</p>
<p>I cup her cheeks - one hand touching her face, the other the cheek on her rear. She flinches, but I tighten my grip just enough to steady her. A flighty twitch is all she can manage before I firm my grip further, keeping her securely in place.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re not going anywhere. Just like when you needed to get those hickeys.&quot; I press in and leave a quick suck on her neck. She shivers but doesn&#x27;t retreat again.</p>
<p>Finally, her crimson eyes meet mine. Hesitation, hesitance... fear. She lost control and knows it. Like I did when Lopunny raped me.</p>
<p>I pull her tighter against my body. &quot;I won&#x27;t force you.&quot; She twitches, hearing my words and imagining what exactly I could force her to do. Just like Lopunny was stronger than me, I am stronger than her. &quot;But I won&#x27;t let you go after what you did either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-you want to hurt me back?&quot;</p>
<p>I roll my eyes. &quot;No. But look at poor little Swole.&quot; She looks at him. &quot;He wants revenge.&quot; He does actually look quite roughed up. I think I should apply a potion after this. &quot;Revenge might not be the right word. Justice, perhaps?&quot;</p>
<p>She looks less afraid and more confused now.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The evil girl needs to be taught how to do it right,</em> he whispers to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Now she tries to stop herself from laughing.</p>
<p>Her hand trembles as it approaches my member again, but I slap the curious limb and shake my head.</p>
<p>&quot;How else am I supposed to learn it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will demonstrate it on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But... I don&#x27;t have a penis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Duh. You&#x27;re going to have to be a little creative when you apply the principles on me later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>I caress her body as she loses herself in her thoughts, touching her gently and then increasingly rougher, just like how Mars taught me.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you have a reply for me yet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A reply?&quot; She has trouble concentrating.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no escape, but everything will happen at your pace. As soon as you tell me to go ahead, I will show you what--&quot; I learned from fingering my pokemon. Don&#x27;t fucking say it! &quot;What is and isn&#x27;t pleasurable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what feels good and what doesn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>&quot;What? Don&#x27;t look at me like that. I have masturbated before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what? You&#x27;re just ramming into yourself with your fingers or what?&quot;</p>
<p>She blushes harder. &quot;It&#x27;s a crass way to phrase it, but to finish it off... yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And before that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well... slow and gently.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you think to start slow and gently with me? Also, what was with the milking? That was strange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My sister, Ruby... she told me men don&#x27;t like foreplay, and to keep a man happy, he needs to be milked dry.&quot;</p>
<p>I want to facepalm. &quot;That&#x27;s not meant to be taken literally. And I think foreplay is great. There is nothing more satisfying than making my girl squirm until she can&#x27;t control herself anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve done that before? With Akari? Wow! I knew she wasn&#x27;t as much of a prude as she pretends to be!&quot;</p>
<p>Fuuuck! &quot;Uhhh, nope. I meant from...&quot; Porn is 18+!! Damn the unbreakable Porygon cybersecurity! &quot;From my imagination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh. I guess men and women aren&#x27;t so different after all. I also prefer to use my imagination when I... you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow.&quot; My flimsy excuses just keep working. &quot;Tell me about it. What are you thinking about when you touch yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes widen, and her cheek heats up. &quot;W-well, to be honest... after the last time you... manhandled me, this was my fantasy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you like this?&quot; She nods. &quot;You like that I could force you to do whatever I wanted right now?&quot;</p>
<p>She squirms but nods again.</p>
<p>&quot;Then touch yourself for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;R-right now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do it. I want to see it. Pretend we&#x27;re in one of your imaginary scenarios and show how you would pleasure yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>She gulps nervously. Her eyelids quiver but close.</p>
<p>Her only hand slowly inches down the front of her body across her thick winter clothes, reaching her visibly moist panties. She begins caressing herself over the fabric.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you be touching your pussy directly if you were alone? Are you too ashamed to be doing it with an audience?&quot;</p>
<p>She nods.</p>
<p>&quot;Say it for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I&#x27;m too ashamed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would Fantasy Swole tell you in this situation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He would tell me to do it anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Fantasy Swole has some good ideas. &quot;Then do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Her trembling fingers slip underneath the waistband of her panties, revealing for a moment the red fluff of her pubes. She looks very similar to Mars. But very unlike Mars, it feels like she&#x27;s giving me unrestricted control over her actions.</p>
<p>&quot;How does it feel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just good? Think of some more adjectives for me. Be a little more creative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pleasant. Nice. Arousing. Comforting--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds like you&#x27;re just describing what&#x27;s happening in your fantasy. What does your hand feel like? And your body?&quot;</p>
<p>She trembles. &quot;Hot. Wet. Warm. It smells good--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What smells good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Y-you do. It feels as if my body is full of pressure. It tingles. I feel tense.&quot;</p>
<p>I rub my hands across her back. &quot;Does this feel nice too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>I trace every single bit of exposed skin on her body - her face, neck, ears, and the stump of her arm. She shudders when I touch it.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you not like that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;N-no. It felt nice. I hate my stump, but it felt nice when you touched it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me when I touch something I shouldn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Her stomach is exposed up to her navel, and I trace slow lines along the soft skin over her muscles. I pause at the arm that vanishes beneath her panties - her skin is lined with goosebumps.</p>
<p>Running out of places, I lift up her pullover, slowly exposing more of her stomach until I can slide my hand across her ribs. My fingers brush against the cup of her bra, but she doesn&#x27;t complain.</p>
<p>I slide my pinky underneath the fabric, probing her breasts. Then my ring finger. Then the rest of my hand quickly grasps her whole B-cup mound, feeling the soft skin in my palm. &quot;Did your chest grow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m still growing.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel the nubby nipple in the center of my palm. Then slide my hand down until I can grab it between my fingers.</p>
<p>She gasps and moans as her stump pushes against my chest. Her eyes snap open, locking into mine, but her hand keeps moving faster and faster underneath her underwear.</p>
<p>Ignoring her pushing, I lean closer to kiss her lips, and she returns it with abandon, sliding her tongue into my mouth. Her stump flails around as if she&#x27;s trying to touch my face with a hand that doesn&#x27;t exist.</p>
<p>The taste of her cherry lipstick spreads in my mouth as she explores with the same fervor and curiosity as she had all those months ago when we shared our first drunken kiss.</p>
<p>I hold her stump while the other hand navigates south, leaving her breasts alone. Past her stomach, it slides over the skin of her busy arm until I reach the barrier of her panty&#x27;s waistband.</p>
<p>She moans in my mouth as I glide past her last layer of protection.</p>
<p>She furiously slicks across her folds until my fingers interlock with hers. Suddenly, she stops, and her whole body spasms.</p>
<p>Her eyes roll up, and her head lands on my shoulder as she presses her chin against my skin. She moans loudly, and I feel her heart hammer against my chest as she pushes her body against mine. Her fingers tighten their grip on mine, and her lips softly grace my skin between breathless panting as if she ran a marathon.</p>
<p>With my hand interlocking hers, I keep brushing against her folds, extending the spasms of her body as long as I can until she slumps limply against me.</p>
<p>&quot;Holy.&quot; She huffs between breaths. &quot;Arceus.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>With a content smile on her face, her eyes slowly return their focus to me.</p>
<p>&quot;How was it?&quot; I can feel how drenched she has become.</p>
<p>&quot;Amazing.&quot; She blinks a few times before shaking off the fog in her mind. &quot;It was so much better than usual! How did you even do that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I barely did anything.&quot;</p>
<p>She looks down at both of our hands still caressing her underneath the panties. Then she shakes her head again. &quot;This isn&#x27;t right. This was supposed to be your reward, not mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reward?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Seeing her in this frazzled, exhausted state does feel rather rewarding, but I have no idea what she means. &quot;You know, because of all the things you did for me.&quot; Her voice softens, rivaling Marley in tone. &quot;The Misdreavus plushy--&quot;</p>
<p>Plushy? I remember! Buneary and I won them at the carnival for all the girls - including Buneary herself. She learned Fling that day to knock over tin cans.</p>
<p>&quot;That brooch--&quot;</p>
<p>What a great deal that was. Some merchant in Canalave City was selling it far under value. Just a few days later, I received my first gym badge.</p>
<p>Salandit versus Shieldon and Pawniard. I swapped into Buneary to finish off Pawniard and then Durant too. The memories are still so vivid in my mind; it feels like it was just yesterday when Durant used Steel Beam, and I cheated with aura to help Buneary avoid the attack.</p>
<p>That was also around that time when I saw Dawn naked for the first time. No, it was the only time. I was holding her underwear out of reach while she only had a towel on.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dusk Stone--&quot;</p>
<p>My prized loot from the Grand Underground. Hatterene was quite the opponent: tough, tricky, and highly intelligent. She would have killed us if it weren&#x27;t for aura beating her ploys. But at the same time, it felt like I understood her on a deeper level.</p>
<p>I wonder how she&#x27;s doing now. Did she figure out my drawings on how to use the potions? I hope she found a better place to be than the endless expanse of salt.</p>
<p>&quot;Not to mention you literally returned me to life.&quot;</p>
<p>The day Alamos Town was destroyed. Erased from space-time, only to be returned through some convoluted machine built hundreds of years ago and the mystical properties of Oración.</p>
<p>The number of casualties was low, and the town has already been cleaned up. In a way, we really saved that town.</p>
<p>&quot;I have done nothing but take and take and take more from you. I want to-- no, I need to return the favor.&quot;</p>
<p>I touch her face, quickly swapping hands when I realize what drips from my fingers. &quot;Zoey. So far, our pokemon adventure has been quite shitty, wouldn&#x27;t you agree?&quot;</p>
<p>She nods and cringes, probably thinking of Team Rocket.</p>
<p>&quot;You, and Dawn, Akari, and my pokemon; you&#x27;re all the highlights of my journey. No matter how strange my journey becomes, I can get through it because I know you are there along with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Swole...&quot; Zoey has only one hand, so I choose to ignore the fluid on my face as she gently caresses me.</p>
<p>&quot;All I need from you in return is to know that you&#x27;re mine - that you&#x27;ll be there for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey&#x27;s head slowly bobs up and down. Her mouth hangs slightly open as if she wants to speak but can&#x27;t find the words.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s get married.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mouth gapes further open until her thoughts catch up, and she snaps it closed. &quot;Hmhm!&quot; She hums her agreement.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she flings her arm and stump around my shoulders to pull me into a hug. She squees, squeals, squeaks, and makes all sorts of sounds as she presses her face into my neck.</p>
<p>We remain like this for a while, breathing each other&#x27;s scent, listening to our shared breaths, and feeling the warmth between our bodies.</p>
<p>Eventually, a cold breeze drifts into the barn, tickling at my nutsack and reminding me of our half-dressed state.</p>
<p>Zoey shivers as well but perseveres and gently grabs my stiff member as if it were fragile.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on.&quot;</p>
<p>She listens, looking in my eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;You said you weren&#x27;t ready yet, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, maybe I was.&quot; She kisses my lips. &quot;I just got a little nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know. I felt it through our aura.&quot; It&#x27;s imprecise, but her nervousness was glaringly obvious.</p>
<p>&quot;Cheater.&quot;</p>
<p>The accusation hits closer to home than she realizes. I cheat in battles, using aura to tip the odds, stalling until burn or poison wears opponents down. But I also cheat on my girls. With Lopunny. And Mars. Not quite with Mary, not physically - we&#x27;ve never kissed, but my heart was already in it. And with Domino, in a way. I technically crossed the line with her.</p>
<p>&quot;I know. I&#x27;m a terrible boyfriend, aren&#x27;t I?&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey shakes her head. &quot;You&#x27;re perfect the way you are.&quot; She doesn&#x27;t know the truth. &quot;And a perfect boyfriend deserves a reward.&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand slowly, gently pumps up and down my shaft until I catch it, holding her still. &quot;I still want my revenge, you know? Poor junior got harshly mistreated, and what I did to you could hardly be called revenge, wouldn&#x27;t you agree?&quot;</p>
<p>I trace the bone of her chin as a saddened look crosses Zoey&#x27;s eyes. She still feels bad about the bungled handjob.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want for revenge? I really don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready for anything more than hand stuff...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;s nothing bad.&quot; The corners of my lips tug up. &quot;I want you to beg for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Beg for what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure if I can really trust you around my willy right now.&quot; Lopunny chuckles when she hears my exaggerated acting. &quot;Don&#x27;t you think you should be begging me to let you touch me again?&quot;</p>
<p>She looks down at her hand that is clearly already touching him. A roll of her eyes later, and she removes her hand, placing it against my chest instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, please let me... you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please let me touch your cock.&quot;</p>
<p>Music in my ears. &quot;Hmmm... I&#x27;m still not quite convinced.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yer having a little too much fun with this, don&#x27;t ya think?&quot;</p>
<p>I made Lopunny go through more than that, so I shake my head.</p>
<p>&quot;Sigh. Alright. I&#x27;m doing ya a favor, after all.&quot;</p>
<p>She gets up from my lap before pulling her jeans up to her knees again. Then, using my leg to brace herself, she lowers herself until she kneels right in front of me.</p>
<p>Her face is on the level of my navel. With some trepidation, her hand comes to a rest on the inside of my thigh, brushing the hair of my legs before our eyes meet.</p>
<p>It feels like another core memory: her blushing face tilted up at me, hair slightly tousled from making out. Her nervous eyes dart around but always return to mine.</p>
<p>My hand moves on its own as I think back on Dawn and my first kiss. I gently hold her cheek and feel the warmth of her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Master.&quot; She whispers, and my heart stands still. &quot;Please, let me stroke your cock, master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet Mew and holy Arceus. Perfection.&quot; I can almost feel myself trembling already just from those words-- &quot;Wait, that&#x27;s not my trembling. Do you feel that? The ground--&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the barn shakes, and the ground quakes. Noise breaches the walls from outside. A voice that clearly belongs to Dawn startles as farm equipment falls from the walls and ceiling, crashing to the floor.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>BOOOOM,</strong> a deafening blast. Dust and loose splinters tear from the wooden wall as a shockwave knocks me over.</p>
<p>Then, as quickly as it started, it&#x27;s over. The ground is still. The world is silent. As the dust settles, I see a wide-eyed Zoey pinned underneath me and an equally wide-eyed Lopunny and Riolu covering me from above.</p>
<p>Riolu&#x27;s Protect gives out, and wood shrapnel scatters to the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;<hr />-.&quot; I can&#x27;t speak. &quot;<hr />-!&quot;</p>
<p>Zoey&#x27;s mouth opens and closes. Her tongue moves as if she&#x27;s saying something, but I can only hear this ringing noise in my ears.</p>
<p>I quickly glance over her body, checking for wounds.</p>
<p>She looks unharmed, even though half-dressed. An invasive thought tells me to have sex with her right now, but now really isn&#x27;t the right time! What the fuck happened?!</p>
<p>I check my limbs and torso for wounds... nothing serious. Oh, wait. A splinter sticks out of my calf. Doesn&#x27;t look too big, so I grab it and yank-- Holy fuck! It&#x27;s huge! As long and thick as my pinkie!</p>
<p>Fuck! Now it&#x27;s bleeding. And there are so many more; I only noticed the big one!</p>
<p>&quot;<hr />d -n!&quot; Zoey screams something before digging through her backpack.</p>
<p>She pulls out a makeup kit and a pair of tweezers from within that. A blink of an eye later and she&#x27;s already bent over my leg, looking inside the wound and picking out more splinters.</p>
<p>&quot;I th--k - --t <hr />m all!&quot; I think she thinks she got them all.</p>
<p>The emergency potion in my pants pocket remained intact. I take it and spray the holes in my leg, watching the tissue slowly, painfully binding itself together again until nothing but pale, circular scars remain.</p>
<p>&quot;W-at th- fuck!&quot; The ringing lets up. &quot;What the fuck was that?!&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Swole!? Zoey!?&quot; Dawn frantically shouts from outside the barn, panic ingrained in her voice. &quot;Are you alright?! Come see this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dawn? What is she doing here?&quot; Zoey whispers as she pulls up her pants. Seeing her struggle, I help button them up before handling my own.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; I whisper before shouting for Dawn. &quot;We&#x27;re coming!&quot; Taking Zoey&#x27;s hand, we cross the battered barn, Lopunny and Riolu trailing after us. Riolu is completely fine, and Lopunny&#x27;s thick fur and defensive stats protected her from the shrapnel. They are in good enough shape for whatever might be outside.</p>
<p>Equipment lies strewn about, everything coated in years of dust shaken loose from the walls and ceiling. A few panicked Swinub scurry back inside only to freeze at the sight of the chaos that has taken root in their home.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry.&quot; Zoey bends down to pet the bread loaf lookalikes. &quot;Everything will be back to normal soon. Go, run to your parents for now.&quot;</p>
<p>They respond just like children would, nodding and dashing off with a single-minded focus to reunite with their Piloswine parents. Just beyond the barn, Dawn stands frozen, her expression flabbergasted as she stares into the distance.</p>
<p>Far in the north, past the horizon, grows a cloud reaching for the sky. Hot air, steam, and ashes rush for the upper layers of the atmosphere, creating a low-pressure zone underneath. Wind flows in from the sides, funneling the plume into a tube while pushing the matter to rise faster and faster.</p>
<p>A mushroom-shaped cloud. &quot;What the fuck?&quot;</p>
<p>Dawn briefly flicks her eyes at me before returning her attention to it. &quot;What did this?! Was it a pokemon attack?&quot;</p>
<p>Images rush through my mind before I unlock my phone to swipe through my pictures. It&#x27;s a few weeks old, but a hint of dread always kept the memory alive in my mind. Holding the phone up, the similarity becomes as glaringly obvious as the heated white cloud that sparkles under the morning sun&#x27;s shine.</p>
<p>&quot;The Galactic Bomb.&quot; The diagram matches the sight exactly. It&#x27;s closer to a prophecy than a mere sketch. Only the scale is off. It&#x27;s so much bigger than I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>Dawn&#x27;s hair flutters as the rising air pulls wind toward the source of the explosion.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the documents mentioned what the bomb is for. What even is there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No idea.&quot; Dawn mutters as if in a trance. &quot;Isn&#x27;t that the middle of nowhere?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s Lake Acuity.&quot; Zoey stares straight ahead, eyes on the explosion, until something steals her attention. &quot;Oh no.&quot;</p>
<p>Wild pokemon - Deerling, Combee, Sneasel, and Snover - run amok across the farm, bursting from snowdrifts, bushes, and the distant tree line as they flee for their lives.</p>
<p>Lopunny and Riolu take point against them. Pokeballs pop open one after another until a veritable army of pokemon stands ready to defend us. But the wild pokemon don&#x27;t attack - they veer around us in a wide arc, fleeing south from whatever terrifies them.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to check on the others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re right, Swole! I&#x27;ll go look for Mamoswine. Can you collect my sisters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, stay safe. Dawn, can you check there?&quot; I point at a building in the distance. A chicken coop, I think. &quot;I saw Daisy going there.&quot;</p>
<p>We split up. The explosion slowly dissipates in the distance, scattered by the wind. And to think Team Galactic has two more of those. Each one could wipe out a whole city like Jubilife City. If they ever turned them on us... &quot;Terrifying.&quot;</p>
<p>There is Penny, mouth agape, and a Piloswine-brush hanging limp in her hand, her nails painted dark. &quot;Beautiful.&quot; I ignore her mutters and simply take her other wrist to pull her along.</p>
<p>In a way, it really is beautiful. Supposedly, it can&#x27;t even harm life. The report said that their scientists built some kind of anti-matter bomb that can only affect matter, and it can discriminate between living and dead matter. Would it destroy corpses?</p>
<p>Truthfully, I don&#x27;t understand how it works, even with the report. But then again, Cynthia said magic is real, so I guess it&#x27;s just a magic bomb where nobody knows how it works.</p>
<p>I spot Ruby among the animals. &quot;Hey, Ruby!&quot; I shout. She glances up from her frantic effort to herd the pigs back into their sty. &quot;We&#x27;re all regrouping in the house!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Got it!&quot; Her voice scares a pig who runs away from her. &quot;Argh! I&#x27;ll come after this, and I&#x27;ll bring Emily with me!&quot;</p>
<p>That&#x27;s one, two, three, and four sisters - counting Daisy, who approaches alongside Dawn. Dawn holds her left hand while Daisy&#x27;s right arm pulls a frightened Swinub to her chest.</p>
<p>We head into the house, where a frantic, panicked Mrs. Evans paces around back and forth, muttering about what she should do.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;re going to need to calm down first, and then we&#x27;ll see what happens next.</p>
